In France, it premiered on December 12, 2015.<br><br>The first season focuses on the premise's basic features of the show before moving on to the advanced features after this season; these features include: having the show to majorly focus on Tarabiscoville than the show's other newer discovered locations, almost every episode (except for "Gekko Saves Christmas") beginning and ending in the day, showcasing what main motives and personalities the three primary villains have before moving on to their minor motives and moving away from their focus of their traits and all of the episode titles have a hero's name, instead of keeping it omitted or having a villain's name in the episode title.<br><br>Season 1's focus is mainly about the introduction of the PJ Masks and their motive on stopping the villains from causing any trouble. It should be noted on a meeting with Christian De Vita, he confirmed that a villain named Firefly was intended to appear in this season. But she was scrapped until the producers find a possible use for her later in the series.</p>

<ul>
<li>This episode, along with "Blame it on the Train, Owlette," marks the Season 1 premiere and is the first episode of the book's television adaptation. Said episodes are also the first episodes to air in 2015.
This episode features Luna Girl's first appearance.</li>
<li>She also appears to show her strongest portrayal of anger than the rest of the series (except for "Luna's Cosmic Tantrum"), screaming multiple times due to Owlette and Gekko helping Catboy to evade chase from the clouds summoned by Luna Girl.</li>
<li>This encouraged Romuald Racioppo to create a book adaptation of the episode by reusing elements and storyline in the episode to create "La Legende des Pyjamasques," while it explores on the backstory of the book counterparts of the onscreen characters and incorporates Luna's temper tantrums to create Sorceline's all-angry personality.</li>
<li>This episode also features the moths' and Alley Cat first appearance.</li>
<li>In this episode, Luna Girl does a tango with Catboy while fighting over the Luna Magnet. It is uncertain if this was on purpose or not.</li>
<li>This episode reveals that Catboy is afraid of water, referencing a stereotype of cats.</li>
<li>This is the first episode of Season 1 that focuses on Catboy.</li>
<li>When Catboy realizes his mistake and finds out how much the other PJs need him, he can be heard saying, "I hate getting wet, but not as much as I hate letting my friends down." This is the first use of the word "hate" in PJ Masks, which could be suggestive/inappropriate for some viewers.</li>
<li>Many of the elements and storyline in the episode are reused and inspired to create "La Légende des Pyjamasques" for the backstory for Les Pyjamasques.</li>

<ul>
<li>During the Narrator's introduction sequence, Gekko's voice was cleverly muted due to it being stolen by Romeo.</li>
<li>This is the first time Romeo gets zapped by his own inventions.</li>
<li>The episode also shows the strongest portrayal of Romeo's smug attitude on trying to look great on everything with compliments from other people. This encouraged Romuald Racioppo to create a book adaptation of the episode by reusing elements and storyline in the episode to create Les Pyjamasques et l'opération zéro for the introduction of Roméo's new motive based on his television counterpart's compliments and Greg's hatred for reciting poetry.</li>
<li>This is one of the first episodes that aired on Disney XD during the January 2022 season.</li>
<li>In two scenes, Romeo is seen without any legs. These two scenes can be seen in the gallery page for this episode.</li>
<li>In the transformation sequence, as Gekko's voice was muted due to Romeo stealing it, Lionel's gurgling noise is muted by mistake. And this error would remain in later episodes starting with the next episode (except for "Gekko Saves Christmas") until the premiere of Season 2.</li>
<li>However, this error was fixed with a French voice actor voicing Lionel in the French version of the show. Despite Gekko's voice being muted in the transformation sequence, his voice in the transformation sequence was unmuted in the French dub.</li>

<p>By day, Connor, Greg, and Amaya were playing frisbee, but Connor's frisbee went into his garden. So once he got it, Greg and Amaya disappeared. By night, Catboy goes out to search for his friends, and thinks that they are being controlled by Romeo. He then discovers they are robot clones who Romeo calls "Robo-Owl" and "Robo-Gekko," while the real Greg and Amaya are being locked in hanging cages. They tried to get Catboy to get them out, but he is overprotective and claims that they don't stand a chance without their superpowers. The robots have all the powers of the originals, plus the added ability of firing energy beams out of their eyes. Robo-Gekko manages to steal the Cat-Car away from Catboy. Meanwhile, Greg borrows Amaya's pink wing hairpins, and uses it to remove the screws holding the cage together. Catboy tries to figure out how to get the pajamas back, which are necessary for accessing the PJ Mask powers. We do not know why the PJ's are required for the PJ Masks to activate their powers. Romeo does not explain how he got the pajamas, but this indicates that he is aware of their civilian identities, and home locations. He mentions he spent 2 years building a Super Computer to power the robots, but it is not clear if he has been battling the PJ Masks for that long or if he began building the computer for a different reason.</p>

<li>In this episode, Romeo introduces Robo-Cat, Robo-Owl, and Robo-Gekko, powered by the Super Computer.</li>
<li>This is the first time that only one member of the PJ Masks headed to HQ.</li>
<li>This episode reveals that Romeo knew the PJ Masks' real identities and names the whole time.</li>
<li>Romeo says that Catboy wouldn't be able to tell the robots apart from the real PJ Masks. However, he most likely would, because the robots act more robotic, and have mechanized voices. This still somehow fools Catboy, though.</li>
<li>In this episode, an alternate version of the transformation sequence lyrics can be heard. However, in the French dub, this isn't included and kept the French-language lyrics of the transformation sequence. This is the first time Lionel doesn't appear in the transformation sequence. The transformation sequence also edits out Owlette and Gekko from being seen in the sequence. However, their parts of the sequence are featured near the end of the episode.</li>
<li>This is the first episode with the word "Vs." in the title.</li>
<li>Romeo capturing Connor's friends while he was a short distance away from them off-screen is similar to Shadow Moth using Sentibubbler to capture Rena Rouge's civilian form's friends and family off-screen while she was a short distance away from them in the Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug and Cat Noir episode "Sentibubbler."</li>

<p>The three friends are excited for the loop-de-loop airplane show, but two adults tell them it's been cancelled because the planes were stolen. Amaya is confident that she'd stop the villain with her amazing flying skills. In the night, Night Ninja is flying around with the planes. Owlette tries to stop the planes with the Owl-Glider, but Night Ninja makes her crash and breaks the Owl-Glider. Catboy and Gekko try to convince their friend to go after him without her vehicle, but she doesn't have enough confidence because she thought she wasn't as good a flier as Night Ninja, due to her crash. Owlette struggles to share a plan with Catboy and Gekko because she thought Night Ninja would beat them again, but her friends finally encourage her with support and they get the planes from Night Ninja.</p>

<ul>
<li>This episode, along with "Slow Down, Catboy!," serves as the Season 1 finale. Along with its sister episode, it is also the only episode to premiere in 2017.</li>
<li>This episode likely takes place after the events of the episode "Gekko and the Rock of All Power" since Amaya asks why they're going back to the museum after seeing the Rock of All Power the day before.</li>
<li>This episode is the last episode of Season 1 focusing on Gekko, as well as the last episode of Season 1 to feature Luna Girl and her moths as the primary villains.</li>
<li>The train from "Blame it on the Train, Owlette" makes its third appearance when Luna Girl was testing out her Luna Magnet's acquired strength from the stolen moon rocks.

Its first appearance was in the aforementioned episode, and the second was in "Owlette's New Move."</li>
<li>In this episode, Luna Girl did not appear to understand the logic that the moon could not be pulled out of the sky, as she focused too much on her desire to have it all to herself.</li>
<li>If Luna Girl was not stopped from pulling the moon to Earth, she would have caused armies of tsunamis and high rising tides that would devastate the Earth.</li>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Season 2</button>
<div class="content1">
<p>Season 2 is the second season of PJ Masks. On June 13, 2016, sources confirmed that a second season had been greenlit. It premiered in the United States on January 15, 2018, and finished premiering on March 22, 2019. It premiered in France on March 10, 2018.</p>
<p>The second season will now start to focus on the premise's advanced features of the show: The season will now focus on newcomer heroes and villains, such as Armadylan, An Yu (minorly; in her dragon form), the Wolfy Kids, and PJ Robot. The Moon and Mystery Mountain are now introduced as new, undiscovered locations. New powers are introduced to the PJ Masks, but these new powers are actually Les Pyjamasques' powers which were already introduced in "Les Pyjamasques et la graine d'Orticia" before the airing of the second season. There will now be episodes ending immediately after the PJ Masks' signature phrase. From now on, there will no longer be any fading-in or fading-out transitions of an episode, as new transitions such as the episode cutting in and cutting out are introduced. The villains' motives (except for Romeo) are expanded to relate to the new locations introduced in the second season. Episode name titles featuring a hero's name has been slightly toned down to now feature title cards without their name or with a villain's name. Episodes featuring more than one villain has been toned up slightly.</p>
<p>Starting with this season, the animation becomes smoother and more high-quality, which would gradually progress as the series goes on. However, there are some scenes that have the same animation quality as Season 1's, the prominent example being the transformation sequence. The smoother animation has first been demonstrated in the Shorts, which have started airing back in July 2017.</p>

<li>This is the third time that Night Ninja works with the PJ Masks, but it happened later, since they acted neutral and attempted to give advice to Night Ninja and the Wolfy Kids on sharing Mystery Mountain. The first two times were in "Ninja Moths" and "Romeo's Disguise."</li>
<li>In this episode, the Ninjalinos are revealed to have names when Night Ninja called the Ninjalino that hurt his leg, Marvin. The Ninjalino that was known as Marvin is also known as Maxime in the French version.</li>
<li>Night Ninja and his Ninjalinos meet the Wolfy Kids - Howler, Rip and Kevin - for the first time.</li>
<li>This is the first episode to focus on Night Ninja.</li>
<li>In one scene, Night Ninja mentions the Mystery Mountain Scroll from "Race Up Mystery Mountain" that the PJ Masks never got back from. This references the PJs' first-ever failure from Mystery Mountain's debut episode, though the PJs themselves no longer worry about the scroll in the entire TV series, and the museum presumably has a fake duplicate of it on display.</li>

<li>This serves as the PJ Masks' Halloween episode. This is also the second special episode of the series.</li>
<li>This is where the PJ Masks and others are celebrating Halloween.</li>
<li>This is the first episode where five nighttime villains appear.</li>
<li>This is the first time that the Wolfy Kids, Luna Girl and Night Ninja teamed up together. So far, this episode features the largest villain team-up, making for a total of 5 villains. Romeo is the only villain not to appear in this episode.</li>
<li>Chronologically, Night Ninja meets the Wolfy Kids for the first time.</li>
<li>Cameron and the other kids finally meet the PJ Masks, but are unaware of their true identities and the fact that they are superheroes.
The PJ Masks deepen their voices so the kids won't know who they really are. They also meet the nighttime villains, but they think they're just bad kids. However, Cameron thinks the PJ Masks are also bad kids.</li>
<li>This is the first time Cameron makes his major appearance.</li>
<li>Luna Girl uses her Luna Magnet to make her moths grow giant for the first time.</li>
<li>This is the third episode where there is no daytime. The previous two were "Moonbreaker" and "Romeo's Crystal Clear Plan."</li>
<li>At one point, Luna Girl goes to HQ and wonders if the place has a doorbell. It could be possible that either she forgot about it or this episode is chronologically set before "Moonbreaker."</li>
<li>The PJ Masks use different catchphrases in this episode: "PJ Masks, let's go as a team. Into the night, to save Halloween" and "PJ Masks, we're a super team. Cause in the night, we saved Halloween."</li>
<li>This episode reveals that HQ has a feature to scare villains.</li>
<li>This is the second time that the daytime kids appear in the night, along with Cameron. The first time Cameron appeared in the night was in "Gekko and the Snore-A-Saurus" when he was sleep walking, while the other kids appeared for the first time in "Moonfizzle Balls."</li>
<li>On Netflix, this episode is listed to chronologically take place as the intended Season 2 episode finale. Therefore, it is very likely that Luna Girl seems to have forgotten about HQ's doorbell despite the events of "Moonbreaker."</li>
<li>In regards to Part 2, no one reads the title of an episode for the first time. However, the French dub of the episode's second part is shown to be the only exception.</li>
<li>This is the fourth time that violence is directly referenced or seen in the whole book series and TV series together. The first three times this theme was referenced was in "Les Pyjamasques et Utupë, l'esprit de la forêt" and "Les Pyjamasques et l'opération zéro," as well as "The Mountain Prisoner."</li>
<li>Luna Girl's moth grows big for the second time. The first time was in "Super-Sized Gekko."</li>

  <h4>Trivia</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>Romeo introduces the Opposite Ray.</li>
  <li>In one scene, Romeo (as Captain Smarty Pants) said "It's time to be a hero," but he only proclaimed that phrase in the French dub of the show, as it is replaced with "Okay super buddy, let's take these villains down!" in the English dub. Also in the English dub, no one says "Time to be a hero" or "It's time to be a hero" for the fourth time.</li>
  <li>Catboy and Owlette are brainwashed and turned into villains with the names "Night Panther" and "Dark Owl" by Romeo with his Opposite Ray. In the French version, however, their names were "Tigre Noir" (Black Tiger) and "Merlette" (Black Bird Owl) to reflect on their physical appearances. Dark Owl is a reference to a villain named Dark Owl in the show Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug and Chat Noir, specifically in the episode named "The Dark Owl." Night Panther's name is a direct reference to the hero named Black Panther from the comics made by Marvel. Romeo is also brainwashed and turned into a good guy with the name "Captain Smarty Pants" by Gekko when he used his Super Gekko Shield to block the ray's blast. Like Night Panther and Dark Owl's names being changed in the French version of the episode, he is known as "Capitaine Super-Malice" (Captain Super Malice). Captain Smarty Pants' name is a direct reference to the superhero named Captain America from the comics made by Marvel. Although Catboy and Owlette are corrupted into "Night Panther" and "Dark Owl," they are still referred to by their normal nighttime alter-ego names at least twice (three times in the French dub) by Gekko until Romeo is brainwashed and turned into a good guy. While "Captain Smarty Pants" is referred to by his villain name by Owlette when Robot turned him back into Romeo.</li>
  <li>This is the fifth time the PJ Masks don't transform back after chanting their victory. The previous four times were in "Gekko Saves Christmas," "Armadylan Menace," "The Lizard Theft," and "PJ Dylan."</li>
  <li>Romeo dejects Robot the second time. The first time he dejected him was in "Armadylan'd and Dangerous."</li>
  <li>This episode also shows that Gekko is good at convincing Owlette and Catboy that they are heroes.</li>
  <li>This is the first time a villain is seen leaving after the PJ Masks chant their victory.</li>
  <li>This is the second time Catboy & Owlette get taken over by one of Romeo's inventions. The first was in "Terrible Two-Some," where Catboy and Owlette acted like babies after being zapped by Romeo's Baby Beam.</li>
  <li>In some scenes of the episode's French dub, Night Panther's voice sounds reminiscent to Catboy's Season 1 French voice, albeit with a deeper voice.</li>
  <li>Romeo says Gekko's name for the first time.</li>

  <h4>Trivia</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>This is the first episode to focus on Romeo, Luna Girl, and Night Ninja all at the same time.</li>
  <li>The Wolfy Kids are the only trio of villains not to appear in this episode.</li>
  <li>This is the seventh episode to focus on the villains.</li>
  <li>This is the first time an episode title involves the name 'PJ Masks'.</li>
  <li>This is the first time Romeo and Luna Girl briefly work together, although they typically dislike each other.</li>
  <li>This is the second time three nighttime villains team up. The first time was in "Halloween Tricksters."</li>
  <li>The PJ Masks were almost defeated by the nighttime villains due to Romeo's gadgets, Luna Girl's Luna Magnet and Night Ninja's Sticky Splats being super-charged with the Mega-Moonstone, but Armadylan came to save them.</li>
  <li>Night Ninja says Romeo's name for the first time.</li>
  <li>This episode is the last episode of Season 2 focusing on Armadylan as well as the last episode of Season 2 that features Romeo, Robot, Night Ninja and the Ninjalinos as four of the primary villains.</li>
  <li>This is the sixth time the PJ Masks don't transform back after chanting their victory. The previous five times were in "Gekko Saves Christmas," "Armadylan Menace," "The Lizard Theft," "PJ Dylan" and "Gekko and the Opposite Ray."</li>
  <li>Armadylan says Night Ninja and Luna Girl's full names for the first time.</li>
  <li>Luna Girl says Armadylan's name for the first time.</li>
  <li>This is the third time Armadylan narrates an episode title. The previous two times were in "Nobody's Sidekick" and "Armadylan'd and Dangerous." This is averted in the French dub where Catboy narrates the episode instead.</li>
  <li>In the French version of the episode, the Sniff-O-Whiff was referred to as "The Famous **** of Roméo." This is one of the few uses of swearing in PJ Masks, which international viewers may find suggestive/inappropriate due to cultural differences. Another instance of swearing in the French version of the episode is after the PJ Masks were freed by Armadylan, Romeo reacted by saying "We're *******, all at the shelters each good under!".</li>
  <li>This is the third episode with the word "Vs." in the title. The first was "Catboy VS. Robo-Cat." The second was "Gekko Vs. the Splatcano."</li>
  <li>This is Armadylan's final appearance in Season 2.</li>

  <ul>
  <li>This episode, along with "Luna and the Wolfies," serves as the Season 2 finale.</li>
  <li>This episode serves as the PJ Masks' Easter episode. Despite being a festive episode, however, there is no special signature phrase or victory phrase for this episode, unlike "Gekko Saves Christmas," "Halloween Tricksters" and "The PJ Masks Save Christmas."</li>
  <li>This episode is the last episode of Season 2 focusing on Gekko.</li>
  <li>In one scene, the teacher is shown dancing when he is hiding the Easter Eggs.</li>
  <li>This episode reveals that Gekko likes chocolate.</li>
  <li>Like Gekko, Catboy is not good with rhymes when he tried to think of a rhyme.</li>
  <li>In one scene, Catboy and the Wolfy Kids make a reference to The Three Little Pigs.</li>
  <li>Howler says “PJ Masks” for the first time.</li>
  <li>Rip calls Howler the nickname that Janja calls Cheezi and Chungu when they mess up: Furbrain. This is a reference to another Disney Junior show called The Lion Guard.</li>
  <li>Running gag: Kevin saying "I’m okay" after getting hurt. This gag would then be used in later episodes.</li>
  <li>So far, this is the closest the school has came to being destroyed (the Wolfies used their Sonic Howl to try and get to the other easter eggs, but they become distracted by Gekko's easter egg).</li>
  <li>It's revealed that Howler hates raw onions, and Rip doesn't like potatoes.</li>
  <li>On Netflix, this episode along with "Luna and the Wolfies" is listed to chronologically take place after the events of "The Wolfy Kids" and "Wolf-O-Saurus."</li>

  <h4>Trivia</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>This episode, along with "Luna and the Wolfies," serves as the Season 2 finale.</li>
  <li>This episode is the last episode of Season 2 focusing on Owlette, as well as the last episode of Season 2 to feature Luna Girl, her Moths and the Wolfy Kids as the primary villains.</li>
  <li>This is the second time the PJ Masks, Rip and Howler work together. The first was in "Romeocoaster."</li>
  <li>This is the third time the PJ Masks and Kevin work together. The first was in "The Good Wolfy," and the second was in "Romeocoaster."</li>
  <li>This is the first time Luna Girl gives her Luna Magnet to a villain. However, she does it to trick the Wolfy Kids.</li>
  <li>Luna Girl introduces her backup moon crystal. The episode reveals that the backup moon crystal is the third moon crystal.</li>
  <li>Kevin moves his bangs for the first time.</li>
  <li>The Wolfies don't know Luna Girl, thus allowing her to trick them into thinking she's the queen of the moon. So most likely, this episode is set before the episodes "Halloween Tricksters," "The Lizard Theft," and "Romeocoaster," in which Luna and the Wolfies already met. On Netflix, this could be evident as this episode along with "Easter Wolfies" is listed to chronologically take place after the events of "The Wolfy Kids" and "Wolf-O-Saurus," and before the events of "Halloween Tricksters," "The Lizard Theft," and "Romeocoaster."</li>
  <li>PJ Robot drives the Owl-Glider for the first time.</li>
  <li>This is the last episode to have the title cards color-coded. As of Season 3, the title cards will now always be blue (with the exception of "Lionel's Powers" as it was green).</li>
  <li>Owlette gets a new nickname: Pajama Princess.</li>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Season 3</button>
<div class="content1">
<p>Season 3 is the third season of PJ Masks. The sources confirmed and announced the third season on January 22, 2018, a week after Season 2 premiered. It was intended to be set to premiere in June 2019, but according to sources it was then pushed forward to April 19, and finished premiering on March 13, 2020. It premiered in France on August 30, 2019.</p>
<p>The third season majorly focuses on the temporary transformation of already-existing characters; these characters would be Teeny Weeny and Kevin (briefly). The season also introduces the evolved characters: Motsuki and An Yu (who technically first appeared in the previous season via "The Dragon Gong"). As of this season and onwards, an addition of new characters from the picture book series such as Santa Claus now appear in the television series, in order to stay faithful with the book series. The episode "Gekko Everywhere" also foreshadows the upcoming Season 4 villain: Octobella. This also covers vehicles such as Romeo's Sky Factory, the PJ Seeker and the Wolf Wheelz.</p>
<p>The episodes that end in the day are toned down drastically to the point where there's almost no episodes with this feature. In a similar fashion, episode title cards that feature a PJ Masks' name has been toned down to the point where there are almost no episode titles mentioning a hero's name.</p>
<p>It is noticed in some scenes where an episode begins in the night, the PJ Masks no longer wear their pajamas before the transformation and now wear their daytime outfits. This was previously seen in Season 2, but it wasn't as frequent than Season 3.</p>
<p>Starting with "Moon Madness," Season 3 also seems to majorly focus on crystals. Luna Girl starts to be called by her nickname, "Luna," more than her full name.</p>
<p>As of this season and onwards, the episode title cards are no longer color-coded depending on what character is focusing. The title cards will now always be highlighted blue (with the exception of "Lionel's Powers" for this season, as it is highlighted green).</p>
<p>As of this season and onwards, the intensity of the missions the PJ Masks faced in some of the episodes toned down to feature little or no fighting sequences and focused more on the main problem in most parts of the episode. It also featured plotlines that wouldn't normally happen as part of the series' premise, as well as parts of the plotlines that look unnecessary and pointless. In response to these flaws of the series, some of the viewers disliked certain episodes that had those aspects.</p>

  <h4>Trivia</h4>
  <ul>
<li>This episode marks the Season 3 premiere.</li>
<li>At the end of the episode, it fades out instead of cutting out. This is the first time this instance has happened since the Season 1 episode "Gekko's Special Rock," which was the last episode to feature this aspect before the episodes started to cut out, beginning with the Season 2 episode "Moonfizzle Balls."</li>
<li>This episode serves as a continuation of "Moonstruck: Race to the Moon" and "Moonstruck: Lunar Fortress."</li>
<li>This is the third special episode of the series.</li>
<li>This is the first TV-Y7-FV-rated episode of PJ Masks.</li>
<li>Luna Girl is the second villain to steal the moon crystal. The first was Romeo in "Romeo's Crystal Clear Plan."</li>
<li>This is the sixth time the PJ Masks and Luna Girl go to the moon. The previous five times were in "Moonstruck: Race to the Moon," "Moonstruck: Lunar Fortress," "Moonbreaker," "Moon Rocked," "Play Date on the Moon" and "Space Race."</li>
<li>This is the first appearance of Motsuki.</li>
<li>The Moon Fortress has grown since "Moonbreaker."</li>
<li>Gekko gets his powers stolen for the first time. The first PJ Mask hero who got their powers stolen was Catboy in "Catboy No More." The second was Armadylan in "Armadylan'd and Dangerous."</li>
<li>This is the second time Owlette gets her powers stolen, only this time, they were actually stolen rather than copied.The first time was in "Owlette of a Kind."</li>
<li>This is the second episode to end in a cliffhanger because at the end of the episode, Motsuki tells Luna Girl that the moon crystal survived and is ready for her to take in the future. The first time was "Moonstruck: Race to the Moon."</li>
<li>The moths are the second acolytes that are revealed to have names. The first acolytes to have names were the Ninjalinos as revealed by Night Ninja in "Wolfy Mountain." Luna Girl comes up with a name for Motsuki when they are already on the moon, so Motsuki is most likely the only named moth at the moment.</li>
<li>When Luna Girl fires the moon beam from her Lunar Fortress to the city, the beam can be seen heading for Panama, a country in Central-America. However, this contradicts previous episodes in which the city was suggested to be located in a US or European setting.</li>
<li>This is the second time Owlette uses her Super Feather Shield. The first time it was used was in "Owlette Comes Clean."</li>
<li>This is the sixth time the PJ Masks don't transform back after chanting their victory. The previous five times were in "Gekko Saves Christmas," "Armadylan Menace," "The Lizard Theft," "PJ Dylan," "Gekko and the Opposite Ray" and "PJ Masks Vs. Bad Guys United."</li>
<li>This is the first time PJ Robot says "PJ Masks, all shout hooray!".</li>
<li>This episode shares the same title with the Little Charmers episode of the same name. Little Charmers is another show starring Addison Holley (Owlette's voice actor).</li>
<li>It is revealed that the Luna Wand has a mirror that can spectate what the PJ Masks are doing.</li>
<li>Luna Girl narrates an episode title for the second time. The first was in "Owlette's Luna Trouble." This is averted to have Catboy narrating the episode title in the French dub of the episode.</li>
<li>As of this episode onwards, the title cards will always have the text colored blue (with the exception of "Lionel's Powers" as it was green).</li>

This also marks the second appearance of the harvest moon. The previous time was in "Moonstruck: Race to the Moon." And since Luna Girl claims the harvest moon happens only once a year, this means a year has passed since that episode.

    <li>The Wolfies are the third villains to discover the PJ Masks' true identities. The previous two are Romeo in "Catboy VS. Robo-Cat" and Night Ninja in "PJ Power Up."</li>
    <li>This is the second time where the PJ Masks turn back to their normal identities after losing their powers to a villain. The first was "PJ Power Up." However, unlike "PJ Power Up," the PJ Masks don't refer by their superhero names, and referred by their civilian names this time.</li>

    <li>This episode, along with "Wolfy Powers," was early released in YouTube on September 25, 2019.</li>
    <li>An Yu is shown that she already knows the PJ Masks' civilian identities. It is currently unknown how she already discovered their true identities.</li>
    <li>This is the first time that the PJ Masks' transformation scene happens lately, instead of showing the scene early in the episode, unlike most of previous episodes.

    <li>This is the second time Cameron makes his major appearance. The first time he makes his major appearance in "Halloween Tricksters."</li>
    <li>This is the second time Cameron and the other kids meet the PJ Masks. However, unlike the events of "Halloween Tricksters," the PJ Masks don't act casual anymore on disguising their voices, and had said their superhero identities right near the civilians for the first time, but the other kids still don't know who they really are. Though, none of the kids didn't know who the PJ Masks are really are, but it's pointed out that one of the unnamed kids recognized Gekko's "Do the Gekko" dance before and after he transformed into his alter-ego, and it would had possibly almost lead Gekko's real identity to be discovered.</li>

    <li>An Yu learns a new word for the third time. This time, the word is "disco." The first word she learned was "high five" in "Meet An Yu" and the second word she learned was "party" in the short "PJ Masks Surprise."</li>
    <li>This is the sixth time An Yu joins in the PJ Masks' victory phrase.</li>
    <li>This is the last episode where Devan Cohen voices Night Ninja. Night Ninja's voice is noticeably deeper in this episode due to Devan Cohen going through puberty.</li>

As of "Invisible Munki-Gu," Romeo met An Yu directly, while Robot and Robette have yet to do so.</li>

This time, since they're not in a group of kids led by Cameron, they finally recognized the PJ Masks' identities but are still unaware the fact they're superheroes and Luna Girl being a villain. Coincidentally, Luna Girl's costume is also claimed to be a "witch costume" by one of the girls, it is implied that it is likely a reference to the villain's counterpart, Sorceline.</li>
    <li>This is the eighth time Luna Girl works with the PJ Masks. The previous seven times were in "Gekko and the Mighty Moon Problem," "Owlette's Luna Trouble," "Ninja Moths," "Romeo's Disguise," "Moonbreaker," "Glowy Moths," and "Best Friends Forever."</li>
    <li>This episode is the last episode of Season 3 focusing on Owlette, as well as the last episode of Season 3 that features Luna Girl, the Moths and Motsuki as the primary villains.</li>
    <li>Owlette activated her "Owl Wing Wind" power by folding and releasing her wings instead of flapping them for the first time.</li>
    <li>Previous events from "Gekko Saves Christmas," "Catboy and the Lunar Dome," "Moonfizzle Balls," and "Moon Madness" are played in the PJ Picture Player.</li>
    <li>This episode's title is similar to the title of the episode "Party Crasher" from the TV show Miraculous: Tales of Labybug and Chat Noir, which also aired on Disney Channel.</li>

    <li>This episode, along with "PJ Robot Vs Romeo," serves as the Season 3 finale.</li>
    <li>This is the fifth underwater-themed episode of PJ Masks. The first four are "Gekko, Master of the Deep," "Power Pondweed," "Pirates Ahoy!" and "Gekko Takes Charge."</li>
    <li>Robot says the first part of the victory chant for the first time, much to Romeo's chagrin: "PJ Masks, all shout 'hooray'!".</li>
    <li>The PJ Masks save Romeo for the fifth time. The previous four times were in "Catboy and the Pogo Dozer," "Catboy and Gekko's Robot Rampage," "Motsuki The Best," and "PJ Robot Takes Control."</li>
    <li>This episode marks the first appearance of the Sky Crystal.</li>
    <li>"Gekko Everywhere" is mentioned when Owlette showed Gekko the video of him with the Teleporting Crystal going from the top of HQ to the recycle bin.</li>
    <li>The Sky Crystal's fate is unknown, though it most likely fell back to the moat where it came from after it floated away for a while.</li>
    <li>It is revealed that the hideout in the moat is located under the city.</li>
    <li>Romeo using the Sky Crystal's powers to make the buildings of the city float to the sky is similar to the Duke of Flappington using magical gems to make the buildings of Barkingburg float to the sky in the PAW Patrol special "Jet to the Rescue." Both villains were using magical minerals to lift things from the ground in order to rule over it from the sky, and did it at night.</li>

    <li>This episode, along with "Master of the Moat," serves as the Season 3 finale.</li>
    <li>This is the last episode of Season 3 that features Romeo, Robot, the Fly Bots, Rip and Howler as the primary villains.</li>
    <li>This is the last episode of Season 3 that focuses on PJ Robot.</li>
    <li>This is the fourth episode with the word "Vs." in the title.
      The first was "Catboy VS. Robo-Cat", the second was "Gekko Vs. the Splatcano" and the third was "PJ Masks Vs. Bad Guys United."</li>
    <li>The Wolfies are seen without Kevin for the first time.</li>
    <li>Catboy drives the Owl-Glider for the eighth time. The previous six times were in "Catboy's Tricky Ticket," "Romeo's Disguise," "Armadylan Menace," "The Good Wolfy," "Villain of the Sky," "Protector of the Sky," and "Romeo's Melody."</li>
    <li>Romeo helps for the third time. The first time he helps was in "Gekko and the Opposite Ray," albeit as Captain Smarty Pants and the second was in "The PJ Masks Save Christmas."</li>
    <li>Romeo uses a megaphone for the first time. With it, he uses it to talk to PJ Robot as they battle with each other at the beginning of the episode and to tell the PJ Masks that he is just collecting the fallen pieces to make his factory even stronger at the end of the episode.</li>
    <li>Catboy (in the Owl-Glider), Owlette and Gekko didn't assist PJ Robot for the first time, as they were too busy collecting falling junk from the factory while PJ Robot and Romeo worked together to fix it. Despite this, they (the PJs) still use their usual catchphrase instead of saying "PJ Masks, all shout 'hooray'! 'Cause in the night, PJ Robot saved the day!" like they did in "Big Sister Motsuki." Also, PJ Robot saves the day by himself (with a bit of help from a villain) for the second time, the first being in the aforementioned episode.</li>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Season 4</button>
<div class="content1">
  <p>Season 4 is the fourth season of PJ Masks. It was announced on June 5, 2019. The source confirmed that they have started shooting on November 1, 2018 and ended on November 30, 2019. It was intended to be set to premiere in April 2020, but it was then moved back to May 15, most likely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It opened up with a 4-part story arc and finished premiering with a 2-part story arc on June 7, 2021. In France, the season premiered in September 5, 2020.</p>
  <p>The season introduces several new features. These include: New characters: Newton Star, Munki-gu, Mabel, Octobella (Full-bodied appearance), Percival and Pharaoh Boy.Both the first and fifth mentioned characters have had their designs revealed at the aforementioned Toy Fair, while the second and third characters' CGI designs were revealed on YouTube, and the fourth character had his design revealed in the activity page on the official website. There are also new vehicles: the PJ Jet and the PJ Sub. As of this season, adapted versions of characters from the book series (aside from the PJ Masks, Romeo and Santa Claus) will now appear in the television series in order to remain faithful with the book series (e.g. Pharaoh Boy being an adaptation of Apophis).</p>
  <p>As of this season onward, the episode format is retooled to change the plots to feel more serious and detailed compared to its childish plots in the first three seasons of the series. Other adjustments include having every episode ending in the nightime, having a special episode at the beginning and end of each season, introducing new characters periodically in interval parts of a season (compared to introducing new characters all at once in the halfway point of a season), include more episodes that focus on the entire PJ Masks, and focusing less on the original three nighttime villains due to the large amount of villains in the series.</p>
  <p>HQ introduces its basement in this season. The PJs (with the exception of Owlette and PJ Robot) get their own PJ Wings. This is the first season to have twenty-five episodes although still, there were 52 segments.</p>
  <p>This is the first season to have the season premiere on the Disney Channel channel. This is the first season to premiere on Disney+ in Italy and the United Kingdom due to Disney Junior being discontinued in those countries.</p>

  <h4>Trivia</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>This episode marks the Season 4 premiere.</li>
    <li>This is the seventh special episode of the series. This also marks the first 47-minute episode. This is also the first special episode to not feature any numbering parts on the episode's title card. However, on Disney+ and the French dub, numbering parts are shown, but the audio is just recycled dialogue from Owlette narrating the first title card, meaning "Part 2," "Part 3," and "Part 4" are only text. In the French dub, Owlette is heard narrating the parts.</li>
    <li>This episode was meant to be released in April 2020, but was delayed to May 15, most likely due to the 2019-20 Coronavirus pandemic.</li>
    <li>The episode shares the same last three words with "Villain of the Sky" and "Protector of the Sky."</li>
    <li>The PJ Crystal makes its third appearance. The first two times were in "PJ Power Up" and "Take Romeo Off The Road."</li>
    <li>In this episode, the PJ Masks' vehicles are upgraded, formed by the PJ Power Crystals, which are three smaller crystals that fell from the PJ Crystal Totem after the Fly-Bots carried it into Romeo's Sky Factory. The PJ Jet is also introduced, formed by the combination of all three upgraded vehicles. This is also the last appearance of the original Cat-Car, Owl-Glider, and Gekko-Mobile, as the upgraded versions of the vehicles make their first appearance in this episode too. However, the original vehicles still appear in the show's theme song for the entirety of Season 4.</li>
    <li>Motsuki is seen in her moth form for the first time since "Moth on the Moon."</li>
    <li>Owlette becomes the first character to get amnesia. It is revealed in the episode that when an animal portion of the PJ Crystal Totem is drained of its power, the PJ Mask associated with it will not only lose their powers, but also lose their memories of being a PJ Mask, though their other memories (such as knowing each other) stay intact. In later episodes such as "Super Super Cat Speed" and "Catboy's Cat," the PJ Masks will no longer lose their memories when the portions of the PJ Crystal is drained.</li>
    <li>This is the ninth time Luna Girl works with the PJ Masks; this happens when Romeo flies over to the moon to steal the moon crystals and Motsuki's crystal.  The previous eight times were in "Gekko and the Mighty Moon Problem," "Owlette's Luna Trouble," "Ninja Moths," "Romeo's Disguise," "Moonbreaker," "Glowy Moths," "Best Friends Forever," and "PJ Party Crasher."</li>
    <li>This is the second time Motsuki works with the PJ Masks, this time in both forms. Like with Luna, this happens when Romeo flies over to the moon to steal the moon crystals and Motsuki's crystal. The first time was in "Glowy Moths" (in her previous form).</li>
    <li>Luna and Motsuki are revealed to have a unicorn cuddly.</li>
    <li>In this episode, Catboy and Gekko get new gear, specifically jet packs and silver helmets. Owlette also gets a silver helmet, but as of right now, this is only seen on the cover art for the show's official Facebook page.</li>
    <li>This is the first episode where Benjamin Hum voices Gekko, replacing Kyle Harrison Breitkopf.</li>
    <li>This is the first time Motsuki drives the Owl-Glider, only in her moth form.</li>
    <li>This is Birdie's sixth appearance. Her previous five appearances were in the episodes "Owlette's Feathered Friend," "Meet An Yu," "The Secret of the Pagoda," and "PJ Robot Vs Romeo," and the short "Bye Bye Bad Luna."</li>
    <li>Luna Girl's eye color converts back to its regular blue.</li>
    <li>This is the second time Catboy controls the HQ Rocket. The first time was in "Luna's Cosmic Tantrum".</li>
    <li>Catboy drives the Owl-Glider for the ninth time. The previous eight times were in "Catboy's Tricky Ticket," "Romeo's Disguise," "Armadylan Menace," "The Good Wolfy," "Villain of the Sky," "Protector of the Sky," "Romeo's Melody," and "PJ Robot Vs Romeo."</li>
    <li>Catboy controls the PJ Jet for the first time.</li>
    <li>Motsuki uses the Luna Wand for the first time.</li>
    <li>Luna and Owlette hug for the first time.</li>
    <li>Amaya is seen without her glasses for the first time.</li>
    <li>A montage is seen of all the PJ Masks in their daytime selves getting ready.</li>
    <li>Connor and Greg start a pact without Amaya for the first time.</li>
    <li>Luna Girl has her own super heist music.</li>
    <li>Luna Girl is shown to be a great dancer.</li>
    <li>Luna Girl drives the Owl-Glider for the second time. The first time was in "Owlette’s Luna Trouble."</li>
    <li>Robot uses a walkie-talkie with a hologram of Romeo.</li>
    <li>Luna Girl and Motsuki are the third two villains to enter the Flying Factory. The first two were Howler and Rip in "Romeo's Melody" and he second were Night Ninja and his Ninjalinos in "PJ Sky Pirates," and "The Disappearing Ninjas."</li>
    <li>The brown girl with the orange dress's name is revealed to be Meg.</li>
    <li>Luna Girl is the fourth villain to discover Owlette's true identity. The previous three are Romeo in "Catboy VS. Robo-Cat," Night Ninja in "PJ Power Up," and the Wolfy Kids in "Wolfy Powers."</li>
    <li>Luna Girl joins in the PJ Masks’ victory chant for the third time. The previous two times were in "Owlette's Luna Trouble" and "Best Friends Forever."</li>
    <li>This is the third time Romeo gets ahold of the harvest moon crystal. The previous two times was in "Moonbreaker" and "Romeo's Crystal Clear Plan."</li>
    <li>The scene of Amaya hearing a strange choral sound coming from the crystals that only she can hear might be a reference to Elsa hearing a voice that only one who could hear it in the Disney movie Frozen II.</li>
    <li>Although Motsuki is reverted back into a little moth, she still argues with Luna Girl via gibberish due that she is still considered her sister and wasn't demoted to her henchman status. Motsuki is also not referred as the "Henchmoth" or "Moth" by the PJ Masks when she became a little moth, instead she is referred by her real name.</li>
    <li>Romeo's backpack has a parachute.</li>
    <li>Owlette is the third PJ Mask to be seen waking up in the morning. The first was Catboy in "Gekko's Nice Ice Plan," and the second was Gekko in "Lionel's Powers." As for this episode, all of the PJ Masks have woken up in the morning.</li>
    <li>This is possibly the longest mission the PJ Masks have ever had, since this mission happened over the course of two nights, even longer than "Moonstruck: Race to the Moon" and "Moonstruck: Lunar Fortress."</li>
    <li>Connor and Greg say their superhero names in the daytime for the first time. They also shout out their superpower moves in front of their classmates during the daytime for the first time, thus implying that the other kids now know about their, and Amaya's, superhero alter-egos.</li>
    <li>This marks the first time the inside of the PJ Masks' bathrooms are shown.</li>
    <li>Luna Girl references her piloting skills from the episode "Owlette's Luna Trouble."</li>
    <li>Gekko can use his tail as a spring.</li>
    <li>In one scene, Amaya can be heard talking in her sleep.</li>
    <li>This is the fifth time that HQ is seen in the daytime. The previous four times were in "Gekko Floats," "Gekko's Super Gekko Sense," "Armadylan'd and Dangerous," and "Super Muscles Show Off."</li>

  <ul>
    <li>This episode, along with "PJ Sky Pirates," "Big Sister Motsuki," "Who Let the Moths In?," "Asteroid Accident," and the previous episode, is one of the post-"The Prank Wheelz" episodes to have Romeo's Lab.</li>
    <li>This episode introduces the Shapeshifting Crystal, and by using it, Octobella is shown to be a shape-shifter.</li>
    <li>PJ Robot, Romeo, Robot, and Robette meet Octobella for the first time, but only when she was disguised as Gekko.</li>
    <li>As of "Octobella's Garden," PJ Robot has seen Octobella in her original form.</li>
    <li>As of "Night Ninja's School of Naughtiness," Romeo, Robot, and Robette have met Octobella in her original form.</li>
    <li>Octobella's room is shown for the first time.</li>
    <li>Octobella is the third villain to disguise as one of the heroes. The first was Romeo in "Romeo's Disguise" and the second was Night Ninja in "PJ Party Mountain."</li>
    <li>Interestingly, all three villains disguised themselves as heroes who are not the same gender as them.</li> 
    <li>This episode has a few similarities with the episode "Romeo's Disguise": Both villains disguised themselves as a PJ Mask member and gave the imprisoned real member something to watch how they impersonated them and got others captured by Robot. However, unlike in "Romeo's Disguise," the other PJ Masks found out that they were with an imposter through her behavior and freed the real member, while in "Romeo's Disguise," the real member freed herself and proved she was the real one through saving the others.</li>
    <li>Octobella and Percival enter HQ for the first time.</li>
    <li>Octobella drives the Owl-Glider for the first time, but in Gekko's form.</li>
    <li>As of "Bubbles Of Badness," she has driven one of the PJ vehicles in her true form.</li>

    <li>Romeo tries to reprogram PJ Robot for the second time. The first was "Robot Goes Wrong."</li>
    <li>This episode is also known as "Octo-Lizard" on some sites such as Disney+ and Apple TV.</li>
    <li>Romeo gets a new nickname: Weird Scary Scientist Guy.</li>

    <li>Like "Romeo's Space Machine," "Legend of the Wolfy Bone," and "Octobella's Garden," this episode was leaked via a storyboard, but unlike those three episodes, only a clip of it was online twice, thus implying that Camille Aigloz only did said clip, while the rest of the storyboard was done by another storyboard artist.</li>

    <li>This episode marks the Season 5 premiere.</li>
    <li>This is the ninth special episode of the series.</li>
    <li>This is the second time the PJ Masks get more powers from the PJ Crystal Totem: Power Furballs for Catboy, Owl Feather Nest for Owlette, Lizard Tail Swipe for Gekko. The first time this occurred was in "PJ Power Up."</li>
    <li>When the PJ Crystal transferred the PJ Masks' powers to the Ninjalinos, the color of their costumes are changed to match with the trio's signature colors.</li>
    <li>This episode shares a similar title with those of the following episodes and shorts: "PJ Power Up," "Catboy Power Up," "Owlette Power Up," and "Gekko Power Up."</li>
    <li>This is the third time the ninjas see the PJs' real identity. The first was in "PJ Power Up." The second was in "Do The Gekko."</li>
    <li>This is Owly's first appearance.</li>
    <li>This is the first episode where Evan O'Donnell voices Catboy, replacing Roman Lutterotti.</li>
    <li>As a result, Catboy's voice during the transformation scene (originally done by Jacob Ewaniuk, while previously dubbed by Roman Lutterotti) had to be dubbed by Evan.</li>
    <li>The PJ Masks Headquarters gets a new upgrade, with new looks and new gadgets. There are Owl Binoculars, Cat Headphones and Lizard Sensors.</li>
    <li>Connor uses Romeo's Freeze Ray for the first time.</li>
    <li>Scenes from "PJ Power Up," "Do the Gekko," "Mission Munki-gu," and "Who Let the Moths In?" are all repeated in this episode.</li>
    <li>This is the first time two victory poses of the PJ Masks were shown.</li>
    <li>At the start of the episode, Night Ninja was foiled by the PJ Masks for a total of 1,075 times, with a majority of those times happening off-screen.</li>
    <li>Night Ninja calling Owly "Tweety Bird" is a reference to the cartoon character Tweety Bird from Looney Tunes.</li>
    <li>When Owlette first uses her Owl Binoculars, she sees Luna Girl chasing Motsuki, possibly foreshadowing the next episode's events.</li>
    <li>Near the end of the episode, the PJ Masks noticed the PJ Crystal Totem's behavior is off and wondered what was inside it, but the book that explains about their powers does not inform them any further. This event foreshadows the PJ Masks meeting the PJ Riders later in the episode "Carly and Cartoka."</li>
    <li>This is the first episode to include more than 3 nights.</li>
    <li>This is the PJ Riders' first appearance.</li>
    <li>However, they only appear as silhouettes in the PJ Crystal until the episode "Carly and Cartoka" where they appear as actual PJ Riders.</li>
    <li>This is the first episode since "Who Let the Moths In?" and "Commander Meow" to air on Friday.</li>

    <li>The transformation sequence is updated to now include the appearance of the upgraded HQ.</li>
    <li>This episode marks the return of the transition scene of HQ transforming into the PJ Rocket. This time it reanimates the scene to reflect on HQ's upgraded appearance, and removes the countdown sequence of the PJ Masks preparing for launch. There is an edited version of a scene in the PJ Masks save the day Facebook page, by the director of PJ Masks, Christian De Vita showing Owlette, Gekko and Motsuki getting crushed by a meteor as the PJ Masks were thinking of a plan on how to rescue Luna Girl and obtain Motsuki's powers: https://www.facebook.com/PJMDirector/videos/1097765134031816/?__so__=channel_tab&__rv__=all_videos_card</li>
    <li>As of this episode onwards, Luna Girl and Motsuki formed a bitter rivalry relationship against each other due to the former feeling no remorse for her negative attitude and actions towards the latter. As a result, Luna was kicked out of the Moon by her sister after finally admitting that she always disliked living on the Moon with Motsuki, and because her backfired plan ultimately put herself and everyone at risk of being sent to outer space.</li>
    <li>Despite Luna's claims of living in the city and causing trouble there, she is seen hatching future plans on returning to the Moon as seen in "Luna Kazoomer," "Luna Girl's Sleepover," and "Luna's Mega Moth."</li>
    <li>Despite that even if Luna and Motsuki are in a bitter rivalry relationship with one another, there is a slight chance that the PJs will help the moon girls rekindle their sisterhood sometime.</li>
    <li>This is the twelfth time where Luna works with the PJ Masks. The previous eleven times were in "Gekko and the Mighty Moon Problem," "Owlette's Luna Trouble," "Ninja Moths," "Romeo's Disguise," "Moonbreaker," "Glowy Moths," "Best Friends Forever," "PJ Party Crasher," "Heroes of the Sky," "Magnet in the Moat," and "Mad With Moon Power."</li>
    <li>This is the fifth time where Motsuki works with the PJ Masks. The previous four times were in "Glowy Moths" (in her previous form), "Heroes of the Sky" (in both forms), "Magnet in the Moat" (in her current form) and "Mad With Moon Power."</li>
    <li>Gekko is the third character to call Luna and Motsuki "Moon Girls." The first was Newton in "Star Buddies." The second was Catboy in "To the Moon and Back."</li>
    <li>The victory pose the PJ Masks do at the end of the episode is the same one they did in "Lionel's Powers."</li>
