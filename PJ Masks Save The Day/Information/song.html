We'll have fun when the sun<br>
Shines on everyone<br>
On everyone<br>
I've got your back, you've got mine<br>
Let's go play in the sunshine<br>
Everything's always better<br>
Better when we get together<br>
We're best friends when the day ends<br>
And the sun's away<br>
We are the heroes who will save the day<br>
School, parties, and our playground<br>
The sun is out, take a look around<br>
We'll have fun when the sun<br>
Shines on everyone<br>
On everyone<br>

Climbin’ up walls<br>

Jump into the water<br>
And he’s ready to go<br>
Swimmin’ so fast after Romeo<br>
He may be the youngest<br>
Behind the wheel<br>
But no one looks cooler<br>
In the Gekko-Mobile<br>
Get out of the way<br>
Shoots a strong spray<br>
This car can do anything<br>
Whip its tail<br>
And peel out of sight<br>
It can go where you’ve never been<br>

Your best toy beside you<br>
Is all that you need<br>
Snuggle up, close your eyes<br>
Another hug for you<br>
Look forward to another day<br>
And dream the night through<br>
Take a bath, brush your teeth<br>

Work together, and we'll find a way<br>
Everybody, shout hooray!<br>

Super Owl Wings ready to take flight<br>
Super Gekko Muscles that can climb the wall<br>
It's time to be a hero, one and all!<br>
Save the day!<br>
PJ Masks are on their way<br>
Shout hooray!<br>
Work together, and we'll find a way<br>
PJ Masks are on the way!<br>
Save the day!</li>

We'll try it again and we'll get to the top<br>
Let's go PJ Masks<br>
We're gonna work together<br>
If there's a mountain too hard to climb<br>
If there's a wall that's a little too high<br>
If we see villains looking for a fight<br>
One more shot and we'll rule the night<br>
Gekko has super might<br>
Owlette flies in the sky<br>
Catboy comes to lead the way<br>
We're the PJ Masks and we'll save the day<br>
Gonna try-y-y together<br>
Try-y-y together<br>
'Cause we're better, we're taller, we're faster, we're stronger<br>
Let's go PJ Masks<br>
We're gonna win together</li>

Use your super speed<br>

Everybody leaping off the ground!<br>
1-2-3-4 everybody off the floor<br>

Flying through the air is just a breeze<br>
You can spread your wings<br>
Everybody wins<br>
And Romeo says that he agrees!<br>
This is how you exercise like Gekko<br>
Gekko always likes to catch the bus<br>
He lifts it in the air<br>
Puts it over there<br>

<h4>Lyrics</h4>
<ul>
<li>Unnamed Female Singer:<br>
There's some magic in the air tonight<br>
Snowflakes swirl and the lights are bright<br>
Across the city, friends are drawing near<br>
Christmas Eve is finally here<br>
But every baddie has a naughty plan<br>
To spoil Christmas any way they can<br>
The PJ Masks have their festive mission<br>
Saving Christmas is a holiday tradition<br>
It's time to be a hero!<br>
And it's a wonderful time to choose...<br>
When you could be naughty, but choose to be nice<br>
Do a good deed without thinking twice<br>
Something special happens<br>
And it makes you feel so fine<br>
Being together, spreading good cheer<br>
At Christmas and all throughout the year<br>
When even baddies start to feel the good vibes<br>
Then you know, you'll know<br>
It's a PJ Masks Christmas!<br>
When you could be naughty, but choose to be nice<br>
Do a good deed without thinking twice<br>
When even baddies start to feel the good vibes<br>
Then you know, you'll know<br>
It's a PJ Masks Christmas!</li>

<h4>Lyrics</h4>
<ul>
<li>Unnamed Female Singer:<br>
Would you like to try some super moves?<br>
Don't be shy; grab your training shoes<br>
You'll do fine, now's the time<br>
To train, train, train, train<br>
Flap your wings like Owlette<br>
Crouch down low like Mighty Gekko<br>
Super Cat Jump, shout hooray!<br>
It's into the night to save the day!<br>
Whoa-oh-oh-oh! (Go, go, go!)<br>
It's time to be a hero!<br>
We're training with the PJ Masks<br>
With Catboy, Owlette, and Gekko<br>
Whoa-oh-oh-oh! (Go, go, go!)<br>
It's time to be a hero!<br>
We're having super training fun<br>
We're gonna get this mission done (Go!)</li>
<li>Unnamed Male Singer:<br>
Flex your Super Gekko Muscles high in the air<br>
Run at Super Cat Speed; do an Owl Eyes stare<br>
Swoop down, swoop up with Owl Wing Wind<br>
We're always better when we train together!</li>
<li>Unnamed Female Singer:<br>
Be fast on your feet (Super Cat Speed!)<br>
Jump to the beat (Super Cat Jump!)<br>
Lift your wings high in the air<br>
Fluttering feathers! We'll do it together<br>
Whoa-oh-oh-oh! (Go, go, go!)<br>
It's time to be a hero!<br>
We're training with the PJ Masks<br>
With Catboy, Owlette, and Gekko<br>
Whoa-oh-oh-oh! (Go, go, go!)<br>
It's time to be a hero!<br>
We're having super training fun<br>
'Cause we're training with the PJ Masks!</li>
