 <button type="button" class="collapsible"><h2>Catboy</h2></button>
<div class="content1">
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/VYb5hTN/character-catboy.png" alt="character-catboy" border="0">
<p>Incredibly fast! Amazingly agile! Able to hear the quietest sounds across unbelievable distances. When adventure beckons, the amazing Catboy leaps to the rescue!<br><br>He can be a bit clumsy at times; this was especially emphasized in "Clumsy Catboy." Although he can be very sure of himself, and has a tough time admitting to being bad at something, he's nice, smart, caring, friendly, helpful, and funny. He prefers to have his own way, but still respects Owlette and Gekko when they ring in with their opinions. On many occasions, like his fellow members, childlike immaturity tends to overtake his mindset on the mission leading to issues.<br><br>Connor has light but tan skin, short, spiky brown hair and blue eyes. He wears a teal jacket with two light teal stripes on each upper sleeve covering a white T-shirt with a thunderbolt logo. He also wears light blue pants and red sneakers with lime green shoelaces. During the nighttime, his pajamas consist of a blue shirt with his signature cat symbol in the middle. His shirt and pants carry the same striped design. He also wears blue slippers. In the winter, he wears an additional blue jacket over his regular clothes and blue gloves.<br><br>Catboy's costume is a dark blue superhero suit with artificial fur, stripes resembling a lightning bolt, and a tail. He has darker blue accents at his feet and a cat insignia at his chest. When going underwater or on space missions, he wears his spacesuit, which includes a helmet, gloves, and boots worn over his regular superhero costume. As of the episode "The PJ Riders," Catboy gains a Riding Armor anytime he summons Cat Stripe King. The armor gives him a helmet with blue goggles, additional armored plates that cover his usual superhero costume, and glowing blue stripes. The one time he became Night Panther, his appearance is identical to that of his superhero identity, but his different color is black with white stripes and dark gray eyes.</p>
<h3>Power</h3><ul><li>Super Cat Speed: His primary power, which allows him to run extremely fast. How fast exactly varies between episodes, but in the most extreme cases he is faster than the eye can see. However, he can only use this speed for short amounts of time (as seen in "Catboy and the Lunar Dome"). He can also use his speed to make things he touches go faster (as seen in "Moon Madness").</li><li>A side effect of this power is that he generates lightning while running, which he can harness for other purposes like recharging robots (as seen in "Robot Goes WrongÃ¢â‚¬Â) and the PJ Crystal (as seen in "Super Super Cat Speed").</li><li>Super Cat Ears: He has enhanced hearing, allowing him to hear sounds that would otherwise be well outside his hearing range.</li><li>Super Cat Jump: Another side effect of his super speed, he can jump much higher than a regular human.</li><li>Super Cat Leap: A combination of Super Cat Speed and Super Cat Jump that allows him to jump in a fast reaction time.</li><li>Super Cat Stripes: A power he gained in PJ Power Up; Catboy can shoot glowing blue energy stripes that can be used to tie up opponents or to grab/hold on to objects.<li>Amulet Symbol: When pressed, he can communicate with his spirit animal (represented as the Alley Cat).</li><li>Prehensile Tail: He is capable of using his cat tail to pick up objects such as a tennis racket or the remote for the Vacuum of Doom.
Super Furball: A power gained in "Ninja Power Up," he can shoot furballs from his hands as projectiles.</li></ul>
</div>
 <button type="button" class="collapsible"><h2>Gekko</h2></button>
<div class="content1">
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/5KVDJxZ/character-gekko.png" alt="character-gekko" border="0">
<p>He's strong, sticky and a master of camouflage! Heâ€™s ready to rush into danger and save the day watch out baddies, here comes the mighty Gekko!<br><br>Greg can sometimes be competitive when it comes to playing games, but he isn't very good at speaking to his class or rhyming (as evidenced in "Speak UP, Gekko!" and in the theme song of the series). He's also nice, friendly, helpful, somewhat shy, fun, playful and brave.<br><br>Greg has pale skin, green eyes and a blond parted hairstyle. During the daytime, Greg wears a light green sweatshirt with brown drawstrings, beige pants, and white sneakers. In the nighttime, his pajamas consist of a pair of light green pants and a shirt featuring a lizard track pattern and his signature Gekko symbol. His pajamas also have a white trim. In the winter, he wears an additional jacket over his regular clothes and green gloves.<br><br>Gekko's costume is a light green superhero suit with artificial scales, a crest on his head, and a lizard tail. He has dark green padding at his elbows, legs and feet, and a lizard insignia at his chest. When going underwater or on space missions, he wears his spacesuit, which includes a helmet, gloves, and boots worn over his regular superhero costume. As of the episode "The PJ Riders," Gekko gains a Riding Armor anytime he summons Power Lizard. The armor gives him a helmet with green goggles, additional armored plates that cover his usual superhero costume, and glowing green stripes. His helmet includes a mask for breathing underwater, meaning the armor can serve the same purpose as his spacesuit.</p>
<h3>Power</h3><ul><li>Super Gekko Muscles: His primary power; he has super strength which gives him the ability to lift extremely large and heavy objects, like a Komodo dragon. The upper limits of this strength are unknown, but he has been shown to perform feats like lifting the entire museum (as shown in "Mad With Moon Power"). However, Gekko has to actively trigger this power with the phrase "Super Gekko Muscles". When this power is not in use, Gekko isn't any stronger than a regular kid his age, and can be restrained.</li><li>Super Lizard Grip: Can climb on walls and other surfaces like a gecko.</li><li>Super Gekko Camoulflage: Can turn invisible</li><li>Super Lizard Water Run: Can run on water. This power has only been used once so far like a basilisk lizard.</li><li>Color-Changing: Can change colors of his costume, like an anole lizard.</li><li>Super Gekko Shields/Super Lizard Shields: A power he gained in "PJ Power Up," he can summon two shields attached to his arms, which he can use to block incoming attacks like a turtle. The shields can also be used as projectiles when Gekko throws them.</li><li>Amulet Symbol: When pressed, he can communicate with his spirit animal (represented as Lionel).</li><li>Lizard Tail Swipe: A power gained in "Ninja Power Up," he can use his tail to create a force that can deflect incoming attacks.</li></ul>

 <button type="button" class="collapsible"><h2>Owlette</h2></button>
<div class="content1">
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/68DMCLw/character-owlette.png" alt="character-owlette" border="0">
<p>She can fly! Has super eyesight! And when she flaps her powerful wings, the baddies are sent flying! Keep your Owl Eyes! on Owlette!<br><br>Amaya can be somewhat impatient at times and tends to have a bit of an ego when something lucky happens to her, such as the time she got a lucky basketball shot in "Owlette the Winner." She can also be a bit selfish at times. Despite this, she is very sweet and cares for Connor and Greg and their safety. She's also helpful, friendly, and smart, but still naive.As Owlette she is very quick with her abilities. Like her fellow teammates, childlike immaturity tends to overtake her mindset on the mission leading to issues.<br><br>Amaya has fair skin, long brown hair and brown eyebrows, though in some of her appearances in Season 2, she is erroneously seen without eyelashes. During the day she wears a red dress with a pair of short red leggings under the dress and a white strip going around the middle of her dress. Her dress also has short pink and white sleeves. Amaya's eyes are brown and narrow shaped with long black eyelashes. Amaya wears red glasses and a pink feather-shaped hair clip on the side of her head. She wears pink Mary Jane shoes. During the nighttime Amaya wears a red one-piece onesie with pink sleeves, two diagonal white lines, and a pink owl symbol signifying her PJ Masks status. Like her normal attire, she wears red glasses, a pink feather-shaped hair pin, and pink Mary Jane shoes. During the winter, she wears a thick, red jacket over her regular clothes, as well as additional gloves.<br><br>Owlette's costume is a red superheroine suit with a horned red owl mask, a red and pink feathered cape, pink accents at the side of her legs leading up to her wrists. She has pink padding at her feet and a pink owl insignia on her chest. She has narrow red eyes with red eyeshadow and black eyelashes. When going underwater or on space missions, she wears her spacesuit, which includes a helmet, gloves, and boots worn over her regular superhero costume. As of the episode "The PJ Riders," Owlette gains a Riding Armor anytime she summons Eagle Owl. The armor gives her a helmet with red goggles, additional armored plates that cover her usual superhero costume, and glowing red stripes. Her cape is replaced with a new cape consisting of multiple armored sections. The one time she became Dark Owl, her appearance is identical to the normal version of Owlette, but the color of her outfit is purple, as well as her eyes.</p>
<h3>Power</h3><ul><li>Super Owl Eyes: Can see in the dark, and see things from very far away.</li><li>Super Owl Wings: Her primary power; she can fly with her cape, like wings.</li><li>Owl Wing Wind: Can create powerful gusts of wind with her owl wings.</li><li>Super Owl Feathers: A power gained in "PJ Power Up," she can shoot energy feathers from her owl wings. These feathers come in various sizes, and can be used for multiple purposes, like projectiles, or to trap an opponent.</li><li>Super Feather Shield: An ability directly related to the above; she can use her owl feathers to create a large shield.</li><li>Super Owl Swoop: Can perform a maneuver while flying.</li><li>Amulet Symbol: When pressed, she can communicate with her spirit animal (represented as the Pigeon).</li><li>Owl Feather Nest: A power gained in "Ninja Power Up," she can create a large, cage-like nest using her owl feathers, which can be used to trap opponents.</li></ul>

 <button type="button" class="collapsible"><h2>Romeo</h2></button>
<div class="content1">
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/2jYRJxD/character-romeo.png" alt="character-romeo" border="0">
<p>A marvel of mechanical mischief, meet mad scientist Romeo.
With all his amazing inventions he plans to take over the world!<br><br>Romeo is extremely intelligent for his age, but sadly, like many about as young as he is, Romeo fails to see the sagely distinction between knowledge and wisdom, consistently confusing either for both. He isn't very physically combative, nor is he particularly arrogant about his intellect, but is very bent and keen on taking over the world and has an ego to prove that he's the greatest inventor. He has an intense dislike for the PJ Masks but isn't extremely violent with them. He usually accepts his fate and flees when he knows he is defeated. Romeo has a very respectful Robot that performs tasks for him and brings him from place to place. Similar to how Luna Girl is with her moths, he tends to mistreat his robot and acts stubborn towards his warnings about the PJ Masks. It could be possible that Robot is his only friend. In "The PJ Masks Save Christmas," Romeo is shown to have a kinder personality. After opening up Robot's present to him, he becomes touched by the Christmas spirit of giving and decides to help the PJ Masks and Santa Claus return the Christmas presents and decorations to the town. Once that is finished, he proclaims that he will be good from now on, but only during the holiday season since he is still a villain after all.<br><br>Romeo is identical to Roméo Mécano, the only difference is that his scientist coat's buttons are square and black in color, wears darker gray pants and boots instead of white pants and normal shoes. Another difference is his goggles look more detailed with a short and thin wire antenna sticking out from the edge of the left lens frame. His eyes are deep indigo (as seen in "Gekko and the Mighty Moon Problem") instead of blue. His hair is black with a white streak instead of being blue, and his hairline is smooth instead of having hair bangs.</p>
<h3>Power</h3><ul><li>High Intelligence: Romeo doesn't possess the acrobatic and physical agility of Night Ninja and his Ninjalinos, nor the assistance of moths like Luna Girl, but he uses the power of knowledge and invention to help him take over the world.</li></ul>
</div>
 <button type="button" class="collapsible"><h2>Luna Girl</h2></button>
<div class="content1">
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/KwBhN3D/character-luna-girl.png" alt="character-luna-girl" border="0">
<p>Luna Girl wants all the daytime things for herself â€“ and sheâ€™ll have a terrible tantrum if she doesnâ€™t get her way!<br><br>Luna Girl can be very selfish, malicious, manipulative and stingy. She tends to become attached to certain items such as a whistle, a microphone, and even a miniature statue. Luna Girl tends to have a terrible tantrum whenever things don't go her way or whenever her plans fail. One of the episodes that majorly emphasized this trait was "Luna's Cosmic Tantrum."<br><br>Luna Girl is identical to Sorceline in appearance, but she appears with a mischief expression instead of Sorceline's grouchy look, and Luna Girl has a smaller mouth than Sorceline. Her black sleeves at her suit is more extended, the lunar eclipse symbol is slightly different, and her hair is silvery gray which is covered in sparkles.</p>
<h3>Power</h3><ul><li>Luna Board: Luna Girl owns a hoverboard-like object called the "Luna Board" which she uses as transportation (on occasion she allows her moths to carry her places). She is able to summon the hoverboard by shouting out its name.</li><li>Luna Magnet: She owns a "Luna Magnet" which can fire a tractor beam to attract objects she wants or traps people in a moon bubble (introduced in "Way of the Woofy").</li><li>Luna Wand: Her Luna Magnet can become extra powerful when Luna Girl inserts a harvest Moon Crystal into it, and it turns into a "Luna Wand". If Luna Girl has her Luna Wand and is on the moon, she can grow large clumps of moon crystals to block or trap people and even heal the moon if it is cracked. Additionally, her Luna Wand can track Gekko when he uses his Super Gekko Camouflage, almost like a kind of heat sensor. In the episode "Owlette's Luna Trouble," Luna Girl loses her powers when an eclipse occurs. It becomes difficult for her to fly and balance on her Luna Board, and her Luna Magnet doesn't work either.</li></ul>

 <button type="button" class="collapsible"><h2>Night Ninja</h2></button>
<div class="content1">
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/br98343/character-night-ninja.png" alt="character-night-ninja" border="0">
<p>A splat-sticking, back-flipping Ninja who wants to show everyone that heâ€™s the best at everything!<br><br>Night Ninja rarely gets involved in a battle as he summons his henchmen, the Ninjalinos, to do his dirty work for him. He is the leader of the Ninjalinos whom he treats like soldiers. However, the episode "Owlette and the Owletteenies" reveals that even he has a softer side for his Ninjalinos. Owlette even mentions it, which embarrasses him. He is incredibly arrogant and haughty. Another time Night Ninja showed that he has a softer side for the Ninjalinos was in "Wolfy Mountain," when one of his Ninjalinos named Marvin was injured. After the PJ Masks helped him rescue Marvin, he agreed to share Mystery Mountain with the heroes and not keep it to himself. He even bowed and thanked the PJ Masks for their help, which shows that he can be respectful and sometimes even kind. Night Ninja has been shown to have a slight fear of caves, as seen in "The Splat Monster," though he tries to hide it, as seen when he jumps at an echo in the cave on Mystery Mountain, but passes it off by saying that he was just "testing his Ninjalinos' reflexes." Then he insists that Teeny Weeny should go in first, and as Night Ninja walks in, he looks to be very nervous. Night Ninja has also been shown to be very intelligent and cunning, as seen in the episode "Clash on Mystery Mountain." Night Ninja  dupes Armadylan into getting An Yu's staff so he could take it from him and use it to send An Yu back into the Dragon Gong forever. He also stole a scroll from the museum that could make him invincible so he could defeat the PJ Masks and Armadylan as well. His plan would have most likely succeeded if Teeny Weeny didn't betray him and teleport him off the mountain.<br><br>Night Ninja wears a fully-covered navy blue ninja costume with nighttime-like stars on it, and cyan accents each on his face and feet. He has blue eyes.</p>
<h3>Power</h3><ul><li>Sticky Splat: Along with the Ninjalinos by his side, he uses colorful and gooey objects known as "Sticky Splat" to pin down the PJ Masks and hinder their moving abilities.</li><li>Martial Arts/Acrobatics: He is very agile and can perform spins, back flips and high jumps at ease. On occasion, he will use a move called the "mega triple punch," which was demonstrated in "Gekko and the Rock of All Power."</li><li>Smoke Bombs: First introduced in "Who's Got the Owl Power?", the "Smoke Bombs" are used by Night Ninja so he can disappear and reappear wherever he wants. He runs off in the smoke and he doesn't really teleport.</li><li>Ninja Fingers: As revealed in "PJ Power Up," he and his Ninjalinos have a power called "ninja fingers," which gives them the power to telepathically levitate any object of any size with only their fingers. Their fingers glow with yellow sparkles when they use this power.</li><li>Teleportation: He is able to teleport small objects such as sticky splat and scrolls that he's stolen.</li><li>All of the PJ Masks' Powers (formerly): Night Ninja stole all of the PJ's super powers in "Ninja Power Up". He got the powers taken away from him at the end of the episode.</li></ul>
</div>
 <button type="button" class="collapsible"><h2>Ninjalinos</h2></button>
<div class="content1">
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/f8RdDwx/character-ninjalinos.png" alt="character-ninjalinos" border="0">
<p>Night Ninja's very own personal army of innumerable pint-sized mini-ninjas!<br><br>The Ninjalinos are very obedient towards Night Ninja's orders. They are able to communicate in the English or French language (depending on the language dub of the show), though, their voices sound muffled and squeaky (only in the French dub) when speaking. They will also follow in Night Ninja's emotions such as the time he nearly cried in "Owlette's Two Wrongs" because his statue was ruined by Owlette. In "Owlette and the Owletteenies," they finally grew sick of Night Ninja's constant demands and criticism and decided to join Owlette. For that episode they were deemed her "Owletteenies." They eventually became disobedient towards her and went back to Night Ninja's service. Nevertheless, they occasionally get along with the PJ Masks depending on the situation in which side to choose.<br><br>The Ninjalinos are identical to the Ninjazouaves. Except that each of the Ninjalinos' accent colors on their ninja costumes are always purple.</p>
<h3>Power</h3>
<ul><li>Sticky Splat: The Ninjalinos use colorful and gooey objects known as "Sticky Splat" to pin down the PJ Masks and hinder their moving abilities.
Martial Arts/Acrobatics: The Ninjalinos are very agile and can perform spins, back flips and high jumps at ease.</li><li>Ninja Fingers: As revealed in "PJ Power Up," the Ninjalinos have a power called â€œninja fingersâ€ which gives them the power to move any object of any size with only their fingers.</li><li>Teleportation: They can teleport small objects such as sticky splat and scrolls they've stolen.</li><li>All of the PJ Masks' Powers (formerly): In addition to Night Ninja stealing all of the team's powers, three Ninjalinos each had one team member's powers and were colored in accordance with them in "Ninja Power Up." The powers were taken away from them by the end of the episode.</li></ul>
</div>
 <button type="button" class="collapsible"><h2>PJ Robot</h2></button>
<div class="content1">
<p>Friend of the PJ Masks, this miniature inventor is the keeper of HQ and unlocks the heroesâ€™ new superpowers!<br><br>PJ Robot is small, cute and has his own language of mechanical clicks, beeps and fizzes.

<button type="button" class="collapsible"><h2>Wolfy Kids</h2></button>
<div class="content1">
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/9bY0mWf/character-wolfy-kids.png" alt="character-wolfy-kids" border="0">
<p>Yip! Yip! Yarooo! The Wolfy Kids are a trio of junior werewolves, always out to cause trouble by racing around town, messing things up, and causing havoc with their combined super-sonic yowls!<br><br>Both Howler and Rip are hostile and antagonistic towards the PJ Masks. But, Kevin sometimes acts friendly and nice towards the PJ Masks, because he doesn't really want to be mean as shown in "The Good Wolfy." Howler and Rip dislike his forgetfulness on what they have planned. Both Howler and Rip also argue with each other. They are also very playful and a silly pack of wolves.<br><br>Howler's daytime appearance is unknown, but in the nighttime, he appears in werewolf form along with Rip and Kevin. He has dark gray spiky hair with two white streaks in the front, sideburns, violet eyes, and claws on his fingers and toes. He also wears a black jacket over a red shirt and blue jeans. Rip's daytime appearance is unknown. In the nighttime, she also appears in werewolf form. Her hair is colored dark magenta with lighter tips. She has magenta eyes and claws on her fingers and toes. She also wears a black jacket over a yellow shirt, gray plaid skirt and red-and-black striped stockings. Kevin's daytime appearance is unknown. In the nighttime, like Howler and Rip, he also appears in werewolf form. He has cyan eyes but aren't seen because of being covered by his dark purple shaggy hair. He has claws on his fingers and toes, and wears a black-and-teal jacket over a black-and-white striped shirt and dark gray jeans.</p><h3>Powers</h3><ul><li>Sonic Howl: All three can create sonic waves with their howl.</li><li>Superhuman Agility: All three Wolfies are quite agile, being able to leap over tall objects. They can run on hands and feet for extra speed.</li></ul>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible"><h2>Armadylan</h2></button>
<div class="content1">
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/Mfv5KwT/character-armadylan.png" alt="character-armadylan" border="0">
<p>A big, strong kid, who thinks he's one of the heroes! Armadylan's pyjamas turn into a bulky suit of armour, armadillo-style. He's invulnerable, super-strong â€“ and can roll himself into a ball and thunder about. With these amazing powers, he's decided to be the best hero ever â€“ but it doesn't always work out that way!<br><br>Armadylan is shown to be quite clumsy due to him unintentionally using his powers which can lead to destruction and accidents towards himself and the PJ Masks. He is generally sympathetic and friendly but sometimes is also shown to be short-tempered and become angry whenever other people try to upset or hurt him at all means. At most times, he has done unintentional villainous acts due to his actions and gullibility.<br><br>Armadylan is identical to Tatouro, except for a few minor differences such as having an armadillo symbol, an orange mask with an armored helmet, and additional armor on his outfit. Alongside most of the Noctambules-masques, his day time identity is currently unknown.</p>
<h3>Power</h3><ul><li>Rolling Thunder: Allows him to use his cape to roll into a ball.</li><li>Dig Attack: Same power as Ulbert, except he is able to dig tunnels in a tangible state instead of semi-tangible.</li><li>Super Strength: Same power as Gekko. They appear to be evenly matched in strength.</li><li>Thunder Thump/Ground Pound: Allows him to create strong earthquakes by punching the ground.</li><li>Armor-Plated Smash Attack: An ability which allows him to destroy anything with a punch.</li></ul>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible"><h2>An Yu</h2></button>
<div class="content1">
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/GQ6SQt9/character-anyu.png" alt="character-anyu" border="0">
<p>Protector of Mystery Mountain, sheâ€™s an ancient soul, half-girl half-dragon, freed after being trapped inside the Dragin Gong for 1000 years. Now she must protect Mystery Mountain, along with some help from the PJ Masks!<br><br>An Yu is helpful towards the PJ Masks when they are in trouble. At first, she shows to be adamant, stubborn, rude, and selfish in accepting any help from them and trying to keep them away from Mystery Mountain by defeating Night Ninja alone, as shown in "Meet An Yu," in which she refuses any help in getting rid of Night Ninja and his Ninjalinos from Mystery Mountain. Despite this, after the team helps her out in defeating the villains, she thanks them for helping her. She can also be strict, serious or no-nonsense, as she requires the PJ Masks to follow the rules of Mystery Mountain in "PJ Party Mountain." An Yu doesn't like the world outside Mystery Mountain, and is reluctant to travel there, mainly because her powers don't work when she's away from Mystery Mountain. Due to her long imprisonment in the dragon gong, and her rarely ever leaving Mystery Mountain, she is unfamiliar with the modern world or modern day customs. In the short "PJ Masks Surprise" for example, the PJ Masks had to explain to her what a party is. An Yu in her dragon form is shown to be loyal and obedient to her former master (Night Ninja) when giving wishes. She can also be fierce and persistent (she kept reminding Night Ninja of his promise to return the mallet to her).<br><br>In her human form, An Yu looks like a girl about the same age as the PJ Masks and the nighttime villains. However, she is much older than them, having been trapped in the Dragon Gong for a 1000 years. It is unknown if this  imprisonment halted her aging, thus explaining her apperance, or if she is ageless and will always look like a child while in her human form. An Yu has tan skin, and black hair that is tied into two hair buns. She has some slight freckles in her face. Her eyes are usually brown, but can glow red when she uses her powers. Her outfit consists of a red and gold helmet with a dragon head symbol attached to the front, red gloves that expose her fingers, a red dress with gold trim decorated around it and a gold armor covering, red leggings, and red boots. An Yu's dragon form resembles the dragons from Chinese mythology, with red and yellow skin and red eyes. She has a long, snakelike body with dorsal fins.</p>
<h3>Power</h3><ul><li>Magic Flute/Dragon Staff: An Yu has a magic flute, with which she can interact with the objects around her, such as rocks or vines. It can also transform into a dragon staff, which can be used for teleportation and flight. However, when in her human form, her powers do not work in the modern world, as evidenced in the episode "The Splat Monster."</li><li>Martial Arts/Acrobatics: However, she is not completely defenseless without her powers, and showed that she could still use her martial arts abilities and her flute, as seen when she used her martial arts skill to scare off two of Night Ninja's Ninjalinos and her powerless flute to lead the monster to the edge of the portal to Mystery Mountain, like the Pied Piper, so that she could regain her powers and turn it back into Teeny Weeny Ninjalino.</li></ul></div>

<p>At first, Luna is quite taken with this cute creature that will follow her around and do what she says. But, Motsuki is a quick study, and soon eclipses Luna Girl in ways of badness! She has a powerful crystal embedded in her chest which gives her power to travel to the moon. It also gives her the ability to paralyze the PJ Masks! How can something so young and cute be so mean?<br><br>Motsuki's personality has changed with each transformation: Originally, when she was a normal moth and later a henchman, she was very loyal to Luna Girl. Unlike other moths, she was smart, cunning, and sneaky, but also very bossy. She can be pretty fast as she is seen being chased by PJ Robot and then trapping him inside the HQ’s vault, and she is more focused than the other moths, who are usually distracted. However, like Luna Girl, she has a soft side. After being transformed into a humanoid moth that now serves as Luna Girl's sister, she decided to be at odds against Luna's demands and became rambunctious and irritating towards both her own big sister and the PJ Masks and has even lost her soft side. Rather than serve her, Motsuki now frequently argues with Luna, and is often treated like a baby, but she still loves and cares about her even though Luna doesn't feel the same towards her most of the time. In Season 4, Luna Girl and Motsuki started getting along more, even though they still argue sometimes, although as of the Season 5 episode "Luna Goes Too Far," they are currently embittered with each other due to Luna Girl's actions (attempting to steal Motsuki's teleporting powers, stating that she disliked living on the moon with her), which she had no remorse about. Despite this, she is very cute, smart, and is a quick learner; her soft side even returned in "Big Sister Motsuki," when PJ Robot wanted her to make the babies act nice and behave well, and when she realized that the babies want to grow up like she does, Motsuki decides to change them back to normal with the baby beam and releases PJ Robot from her moon bubble afterwards. In "Heroes of the Sky," when she temporarily turned back to a normal moth, her personality remained the same as when she was a humanoid, as she says that she also wants to be in charge as well, albeit using gibberish.<br><br>Motsuki is teal in appearance, wears a lilac and purple suit with a pink crystal on it. She has four arms, wings, pink eyeballs, purple eyes and purple eyelids, as well as a pudgy belly. Before being transformed into a humanoid moth, Motsuki was largely identical to Luna Girl’s typical moths. However, she has glowing marks all over her body and wings, and on her forehead is a glowing moon mark. When using her sensing power, her eyes are glowing pink. And before being promoted as Luna Girl's henchman, Motsuki was originally a regular moth, identical to the other moths with no physical difference to her at all.</p>
<h3>Power</h3><ul><li>Moon Bubble: An upgraded version of her lunar beam power that allows her to shoot a beam from her antennae that can trap opponents in moon bubbles.
Teleportation: Motsuki can teleport herself and others from Earth to the moon, and back again.</li><li>Crystal Summoning: Motsuki can make crystals grow from the ground to trap anyone, including Luna Girl.</li><li>Psychic Vision: Motsuki can use her mind to see where people or things are.</li></ul>

<p>A trickster, a teaser, a hoaxster. Meet Munki-Gu, a little monkey who was trapped inside a monkey statue on Mystery Mountain for 1000 years â€“ for being too naughty! Accidentally freed by the PJ Masks, this prankster monkey brings unwanted but at times, useful, comedy and chaos to their world. Munki-Gu uses his powers to outwit and trick whoever he meets â€“ so watch out!<br><br>At first, Munki-gu appears to be an innocent monkey. However, he then reveals himself to be mischievous and naughty once Gekko accidentally patted his head 3 times. Munki-gu is also shown to be a very disobedient monkey as he refuses to listen to others, especially the PJ Masks. As naughty as he is, he's also shown to be a very funny and silly monkey as he likes playing and pulling pranks on others.<br><br>Munki-gu is a monkey with gray fur and tan skin.

<div class="content1">
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/XFq3tgT/character-octobella.png" alt="character-octobella" border="0">
<p>A villainous octopus-like character who lives in the canals below the city, Octobella introduces herself as a â€˜squiggly giggly octopus girlâ€™ â€“ but be wary of her cute facade! She lurks in her very own crystal garden where she collects and protects some very special underwater crystals â€“ trophies she likes to show off to the PJ Masks. She has a loyal and very speedy sidekick shrimp too called Percival.<br><br>Octobella's very possessive of the crystals and other things in the moat, which she deems as "hers," and is vengeful and unforgiving to those who she believes are stealing them from her, as shown when she tries to trap Gekko underwater forever after claiming that he took the power pondweed. She's also quite deceptive. She used the fact that the PJ Masks didn't know who she was to her advantage by pretending to be their friend so she can kidnap Gekko and get revenge on other PJ Masks. Despite her unforgiving nature towards the PJ Masks, Octobella, like other nighttime villains, seems to have a soft spot for her sidekick, Percival, though, like how Luna Girl and Night Ninja do to the Moths and Ninjalinos, respectively, she does tend to tease him a lot as seen in "Magnet in the Moat," much to his annoyance.<br><br>Octobella's body takes the form of an octopus, with nine tentacles on her head and six more on her lower body, implying that she is more of a hexapus. She has blue eyes and a light turquoise face with yellow markings. The majority of her body is turquoise with blue and yellow bands around her body and tentacles and one dark aqua dorsal fin each on her forearms. The tips of her tentacles glow an aqua color, though at one point in "Pondweed Party," her body glowed the same hue. However, in "Gekko Everywhere," her tentacle seems to be a darker turquoise hue, and the aqua-colored tip doesn't glow. She also wears a purple beaded necklace with a dark purple shell hanging in the middle where she places one of her magic crystals. The main crystal usually placed in there is a purple one.</p> 
<h3>Power</h3><ul><li>Crystal Current: Octobella can create powerful whirlpools which she uses to trap her enemies and spin them around.</li><li>Camouflage: Just like real life octopuses and Gekko, Octobella can change the colors of her body allowing her to turn transparent and become invisible.</li>
<li><ul>Magic Crystals:
  <li>Underwater Crystal: She uses this magic crystal that has the ability to shoot powerful blasts of water at her opponents and trap them in crystals.</li>
<li>Shapeshifting Crystal: She uses this magic crystal that gives her the ability to shapeshift into anyone.</li>
<li>Pondstone Crystal: She uses this magic crystal to make things faster and control things that come into contact with it.</li></ul><li>
<li>Glowing Orbs: She can summon crystal orbs that are like Luna Girl's Moonfizzle Balls from the deep that hypnotizes her enemies into playing with them while she carries out her plan.</li>
<li>Magic Octopus Ink: This ink allows her to create portals between her lair and other places. Additionally, like real life octopuses, she uses this weapon to blind her enemies so she hides safely.</li>
<li>Sonic Song: She can create sonic waves with her country western yodeling abilities while underwater.</li>
<li>Octobella can temporarily give others the ability to breathe underwater, like she did with Luna Girl and Motsuki in "Magnet in the Moat" and Armadylan in "Octobella's Garden."</li>
<li>Bubbles of Badness: Controlled by the pondstone crystal, she uses these to entrap anything or anyone. They can only be popped by using said crystal.</li>

<p>The original boy king, who has found a portal into our world â€“ in the museum. Pharaoh Boy is a total megalomaniac â€“ like Romeo but with strange ancient Egyptian powers and a conviction that he was born to rule. He wants to take over the city and rule it for all time that's his one wish, and he pursues it determinedly. This is a boy king to be reckoned with.<br><br>Pharaoh Boy is extremely arrogant, believing himself to be the ruler of the world and everyone to be his servants. He thus demands that people obey his orders without question, and can get angry when they refuse.<br><br>Pharaoh Boy is almost identical to Apophis, except his costume is blue and orange instead of black and yellow, his mouth is not covered with bandages while parts of his bandages are repurposed as gauntlets and boots, and he lacks a cobra at his headdress (as his archetypical appearance of a typical mummy is changed to look like a real pharaoh, in order to fit with the other villains' arrogant traits and qualities of the series). His eyes are indigo, compared to his book counterpart's brown eyes. He has dark skin.</p>
<h3>Power</h3><ul><li>Staff of Ra: Pharaoh Boy owns the Staff of Ra which grants him various magical abilities, like turning people into his loyal servants or possessing other creatures.

She is also misunderstood about how her plants are lovely to her, despite being told that they are spiky and cause trouble.<br><br>Orticia retains the same appearance as that of her original book counterpart, with the exception of lacking mini-venus flytraps at the sides of her head (as she is not an Ancient Greek-themed villain, and to be more grounded to her nature themes). She also has legs, whereas her book counterpart's body was a vine from the waist down.</p> 
<h3>Powers</h3><ul><li>Florakinesis: Orticia has full control over plants and plant life. She can instantly grow plants wherever she is, order plants to fight for her, or give plants increased intelligence, like when she created the Pumpkins.
