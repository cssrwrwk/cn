<h1>Locations</h1>
<p>PJ Masks has many locations for all PJ Masks fans to play and use. There are 29 locations in total for PJ Masks. A place to know more about each locations of PJ Masks.</p>
<p>Tarabiscoville is where the PJ Masks' current residence is located, and a cartoon counterpart of Tarabiscoville from another universe set in a science fictional setting.</p>
<br>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Ancient Temple</button>
<div class="content1">
  <p>The Ancient Temple is an as of yet unseen location mentioned by Night Ninja in "Gekko and the Rock of All Power." It is a place where Night Ninja and his Ninjalinos train their martial arts. However, it is unknown where the exact location the temple is at. It is also the former location of The Rock of All Power.</p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Crystal Garden</button>
<div class="content1">
  <p>The Crystal Garden is an underwater location in the moat. It is the home of Octobella and Percival. As the name suggests, the garden contains batches of crystals and has lanterns either hanging or mounted around the area. The location is surrounded by an underwater forest that is too thick for the Gekko-mobile to navigate through, but not the PJ Sub, most likely due to the vehicles' different sizes. In the middle of the garden is Octobella's lair, where she keeps her books and magical items. Also inside the lair is a jail to imprison her captives.</p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Luna Lair</button>
<div class="content1">
  <p>The Luna Lair was Luna Girl's lair before she created the Lunar Fortress. Here, she used to plan her motives to wreak havoc in Tarabiscoville. It was also the home of her moths that help her with her evil schemes. It is shown in "Owlette and the Giving Owl," and mentioned in "Owlette's Feathered Friend."
  <br><br>
  The lair itself is in the shape of a sphere and has a door that comes down from above for Luna Girl to come out of. It is silver and has the ability to float away. It also has some defense mechanisms, such as a force field to keep intruders away, and an automatic Luna Beam to capture and immobilize those attempting to break in. However, it's unknown what is inside the Luna Lair. The lair has not been seen since the Lunar Fortress became Luna Girl's new home. It is unknown if she still has the lair somewhere.</p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Luna Fortress</button>
<div class="content1">
  <p>The Lunar Fortress is a crystal palace located on the Moon.<br><br>It was created by Luna Girl in "Moonstruck: Race to the Moon" after she first got her hands on the Moon Crystal and used it to turn her Luna Magnet into a Luna Wand. For a while, the fortress became Luna's primary lair. Initially, she could only visit it when she had the moon crystal or found other ways to reach the moon, like hitching a ride in PJ Masks Headquarters. After she gained Motsuki as a sister, who could teleport her to the moon, Luna Girl permanently took up residence in the fortress. Eventually, in "Luna Goes Too Far," Luna was kicked out of the fortress by Motsuki after admitting to her that she doesn't like living on the moon with her. Motsuki has since claimed the fortress for herself.<br><br>The fortress has, among other things, a throne for Luna Girl and various statues of her. In "Moon Madness," she upgraded the fortress with a mega magnet, capable of generating a moonbeam that could pull objects from Earth to the moon. At the end of the episode, though, the mega magnet was destroyed by the PJ Masks. Then in "Heroes of the Sky," the fortress was temporarily destroyed when Romeo ordered the Fly Bots to steal the moon crystals that kept the fortress stable.<br><br>It seems that the inside of the Lunar Fortress has oxygen inside of it as Luna Girl doesn't have the pink aura around her when she's inside. However, the PJ Masks still wear their spacesuits when inside.</p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Master Fang's Doji</button>
<div class="content1">
  <p>Master Fang's Dojo is a building that's located in the park. It is the place where Master Fang both teaches his kung-fu classes and broadcasts his TV show. It makes a major appearance in "Catboy and Master Fang's Sword."</p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Milk Shake Shop</button>
<div class="content1">
  <p>The Milk Shake Shop is a place where people buy milkshakes. It is located in the neighborhood where the PJ Masks reside, beside Greg's House. Though, none of the episodes show people buying there.</p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Moon</button>
<div class="content1">
  <p>The Moon is a recurring location seen visible in the during the night in every episode. It is the former lair of Luna Girl and is the home of Motsuki, as of "Luna Goes Too Far" onwards. In the episode "Moonstruck: Race to the Moon," the PJ Masks first visited the moon to stop Luna Girl from getting her hands on a Moon Crystal. Luna Girl used this crystal to build herself a Lunar Fortress on the surface of the moon. The moon has since been visited several times, including by Romeo. It is the primary setting of the episodes "Moonbreaker," "Moon Madness," and "Moth on the Moon," as well as the shorts "Moon Rocked," "Play Date on the Moon," and "Space Race." Originally, the PJ Masks had great trouble operating on the moon since their powers worked differently there than on Earth. This issue was solved by PJ Robot in "Moon Madness" when he upgraded their spacesuits.</p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Museum</button>
<div class="content1">
  <p>The Museum is Tarabiscoville's local building for historical pieces such as dinosaur models, artworks, books, and occasionally, something moon themed, such as a moonstone. It is also the cartoon counterpart of the Museum set in the Cartoon Continuity. Besides rooms with exhibitions, the museum also has a library.
  <br><br>
  The museum has been damaged and broken into several times by Luna Girl, Night Ninja, the Wolfy Kids, and most primarily Romeo. It is particularly prone to being targeted by a nighttime villain whenever there is a new exhibit that said villain hopes to use for his/her latest plan. It was even broken into by Armadylan once, to protect a moonstone from being stolen.
  <br><br>
  Newton Star likes to hang out in the museum's library during the daytime. It has a claw game located in its lobby. In "Gekko Saves Christmas," the museum's entrance is replaced with an ice rink. The Egyptian exhibit contains a sphinx statue with a portal that leads to The World Beyond.</p>

</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Romeopolis</button>
<div class="content1">
<p>Romeopolis, also known as Romeoville, is the dream utopia that refers to Romeo's intended plan on turning Tarabiscoville into his own private city dedicated to himself.
<br><br>
At one point, the dream utopia's establishment temporarily succeeded in "Gekko and the Mayhem at the Museum" with the Big Box of Bad. In the end, the PJ Masks managed to seize control of the city's territory by destroying the Big Box of Bad. Its main enemies are the PJ Masks and anyone who opposes Romeo's idea on taking over the world.</p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">School</button>
<div class="content1">
<p>The School is a building in which it serves as a TV counterpart of the School, and is seen in most of the TV series' daytime scenes.
<br><br>
There is an unnamed Teacher that teaches Connor, Greg, Amaya and Cameron's class, but it is uncertain which grade he teaches.
<br><br>
There is also a playground that several scenes are set in, such as when Amaya won a basketball game with a lucky shot.
<br><br>
In "All About Asteroids," Greg asks Newton Star which school he goes to, which could indicate that this is not the only elementary school in Tarabiscoville. This could also explain why the nighttime villains and Armadylan are never seen attending this school. However, Newton's biography on the PJ Masks site states he is from another city, and thus most likely goes to school there.</p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Park</button>
<div class="content1">
<p>The Park is a leisure area, and is seen in some of the TV series' daytime scenes which are set. Along with it is a track, a forest and Master Fang's Dojo.

<p>The World Beyond is an as of yet unseen location in the PJ Masks television series. It is the world from which Pharaoh Boy originally comes, and where he resides between his plans to take over the world.
<br><br>
Considering that Pharaoh Boy is a mummy, the World Beyond may or may not be an afterlife of some sort. It can be entered and exited through a portal hidden inside a sphinx statue in the Museum. In his debut episode, Pharaoh Boy admits that he has been spying on the Museum and the PJ Masks for some time already from the World Beyond.</p>
</div>

<div class="content1">
<p>The Toy Shop is a place where the people buy toys. It is first identified in "Owlette the Winner" when Luna Girl organizes a competition for the moths to steal the toys from the store. In later appearances such as "Battle Of The Fangs," it is identified as a music store.</p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Underwater Cave</button>
<div class="content1">
<p>The Underwater Cave is an underground cavern that first appeared in "Gekko, Master of the Deep."
<br><br>
In the episode "Gekko, Master of the Deep," the PJ Masks sent Gekko to travel in the cave to stop Romeo whom he decided to use the cave as his hideout, while facing his fears.
<br><br>
In "Power Pondweed," the PJ Masks had to stop Romeo from obtaining the power pondweed that is powered up by the PJ Crystal Totem at the moat.
<br><br>
In "Master of the Moat," Romeo tricked the PJ Masks into thinking that Gekko would become "Master of the Moat" by using the Sky Crystal as bait.
<br><br>
In "Pondweed Party," Octobella tricked Orticia into helping her grow a pondweed plant to imprison the PJ Masks and trapped her with them so she can keep it growing in case she needed it again.</p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Zoo</button>
<div class="content1">
<p>The Zoo is the place where the animals are preserved, and is the cartoon counterpart of the Zoo. It first appeared in "Catboy and the Butterfly Brigade," then in "Owlette's Feathered Friend."
<br><br>
Unlike its book counterpart, it is portrayed as a sanctuary in a more positive light rather than looking like a literal prison for trapped animals.</p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Zoomzania</button>
<div class="content1">
<p>Zoomzania, nicknamed The World of Speed, is a location in the PJ Masks television series. It is the world where the Speedy Twins come from. It was first seen in the Season 5 episode "Carly and Cartoka."
<br><br>
The exact nature of Zoomzania is currently unknown; it could be a different dimension like Mystery Mountain, or another planet somewhere in space. The latter seems more likely since other planets can be seen in the sky from Zoomzania's surface. Regardless of its location, radio contact between Earth and this world is still possible with the PJ Communicators.
<br><br>
Carly and Cartoka can travel between this world and Earth using portals, which are triggered by their speed. Catboy and Cat Stripe King can also create these portals due to them being speedsters.
<br><br>
Zoomzania appears to be mostly a barren, rocky wasteland, but the twins built a huge set of race tracks there to satisfy their desire to go fast. As revealed in "Crash Track Trick," the place is also filled with Zoom Crystals, which can only be obtained if the person is going really fast, something the Flashcar is not able to accomplish. It is unknown if Carly and Cartoka are the only inhabitants of Zoomzania.</p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Sky Factory</button>
<div class="content1">
<p>The Sky Factory (referred to as the Flying Factory in the television series) is a steampunk vehicle that travels in the air. Since it's debut, it has served as Romeo's primary base of operations, replacing the mobile laboratory.
<br><br>
The Sky Factory has a control room to control the factory, contains various machines such as its metal-sucking nozzle vacuum (referred as the Sucky Sucker), a mounted ray and expels gum clouds to pollute the environment. The Fly Bots take care of the factory for Romeo, while Robette serves as the co-pilot of the factory.
<br><br>
It first appeared in the Season 3 episode "Villain of the Sky," where it turned out to be the source of the expelled black and stinky gunk clouds in the air while it was being finished.
<br><br>
In "Protector of the Sky," Romeo used the factory to spread gunk clouds around the city and suck up everything using its metal-sucking nozzle machine. However, after a minor fight, the PJ Masks managed to stop Romeo by overriding the controls, causing the nozzle to suck up the gunk clouds and mess with the controls. Romeo and Robot tried to go after the team, but they ended up falling off the factory and into one of the gunk clouds, so they could not cause any trouble again that time.
<br><br>
In "The PJ Masks Save Christmas," after discovering he was on the naughty list, Romeo decided to ruin Christmas by capturing Santa Claus in his Sky Factory.
<br><br>
In "Romeo's Melody," Romeo captured a few animals, including Howler, Rip, and Armadylan, hypnotized them with a newly created melody, and had them exercise to create energy for the factory.
<br><br>
In "PJ Robot Takes Control," PJ Robot took control of the Fly Bots and turned the factory into the "Fun Factory."
<br><br>
In "PJ Sky Pirates," Romeo's Lab was being kept in the factory. It has yet to be determined if he will use the vehicle again in the future, although he likely will. This is proven to be true, as the lab was seen "Big Sister Motsuki."
<br><br>
In "The Disappearing Ninjas," Romeo sent his factory to Mystery Mountain.
<br><br>
In "Master of the Moat," Romeo used the Sky Crystal to make his own world in the clouds.
<br><br>
In "PJ Robot Vs Romeo," the Sky Factory was losing pieces and Romeo and PJ Robot, despite not wanting to do it at first causing Robot to initiate psychiatrist mode, decided to work together while the PJs collect stray pieces.
<br><br>
In "Heroes of the Sky," the Sky Factory was used in an available plot to create multiple Sky Factories. Romeo used the power of several moon crystals and the PJ Crystal to build a ray that would, when at the edge of space, make more Sky Factories. However, after the PJ Masks and Luna Girl got back their crystals, the Sky Factories shrunk and fell.
<br><br>
In "Asteroid Accident," Romeo went after the PJ Masks in the Sky Factory in order to get the asteroid back, zapping them in the process. He also zapped the asteroid while the PJ Masks and Newton Star were on it. After Newton was able to surf the rock towards the factory and hit its ray, the invention zapped the factory, sending it spiraling back to Earth.
<br><br>
In "Romeo's Space Machine," Romeo used his Space Machine to suck up all the things from the city.
<br><br>
In "Flying Factory Out of Control," the PJ Masks celebrated Romeo's birthday in the factory.
<br><br>
In "Mission Munki-gu," his factory was taken over by Munki-gu, which later went into space.
<br><br>
In "Robo-Wolf," Kevin was launched into the factory in order to get extra parts for the Wolfy Kids' homemade robot. He stole the new Robot Controller that Romeo invented for Robot and left with Robot in pursuit, but when the PJ Masks arrived to confront Romeo, he accused them of stealing the remote and used his new Truth Ray to make them confess, but to no avail. PJ Robot helped them escape afterwards.
<br><br>
In "Lost in Space," the factory was sent into space after Owlette accidentally launched a set of feathers at it from the PJ Jet. While Romeo made the repairs to return to Earth, he upgraded the computer to come up with a new plan. However, the computer, then named Mabel, took the place over afterwards, along with the Fly Bots, Robette, and the satellites. She was later defeated when the PJ Masks, Romeo, and Robot decided to work together.
<br><br>
In "By My Pharaoh Feathers," Pharaoh Boy took over the factory while Owlette attempted to get revenge on Romeo using her Super Owl Feathers, which he deemed as useless. Initially opposed to the idea, after learning that her feathers had caused the current situation, she finally agreed to help him.
<br><br>
In "PJ Robot Malfunction," Romeo used a robot bug to reprogram PJ Robot so that he'll turn against the PJ Masks.
<br><br>
In "Battle Of The Fangs," after hearing the Wolfy Kids' new band, Romeo offered to be their manager while at the same time planned to use their sound in order to power up the Sucky Sucker and blow the town away. However, after revealing how he truly felt about their music and Kevin sent the factory away with his solo act, Howler and Rip fired him, and Robot, Robette, and the Fly Bots created a new band for him, much to his dismay.
<br><br>
In "Owly Tricks," Romeo uses a Hologram Machine to make a projection of Owly, while spying on the PJM's from inside the flying factory.
<br><br>
In "Pirate Robot," Romeo uses a machine inside the factory, intentionally making a chef, but accidently creating Pirate Robot, due to the fact that Night Ninja had dropped his Pirate Hat into the machine.
<br><br>
The factory is the home of Romeo, Robot, Robette, Toolbox, Spy-Bot and the Fly Bots. The Sky Factory features a Multiplying Machine.</p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Mystery Mountain</button>
<div class="content1">
<p>Mystery Mountain is a location first seen in the episode "Race Up Mystery Mountain." It is the former lair of Night Ninja and is also the home of An Yu, as revealed in "Meet An Yu," and Teeny Weeny.
<br><br>
The exact nature of Mystery Mountain is inconsistent throughout the series. Most of the time, it is suggested to be located in another dimension or world, but as of Season 3 (and in some Season 2 episodes), it is also sometimes depicted as an island floating on a cloud above the city.
<br><br>
Mystery Mountain is, as its name suggests, a mountain. There is a single path with stairs that leads from the foot of the mountain to the top. There are four other paths in the bamboo forest, but it is unknown where they lead to.
<br><br>
Mystery Mountain is surrounded by a bamboo forest. It contains a pagoda on top, various caves inside, one of which can serve as a dungeon, and various ornaments at the foot and along the path, all of which resemble ancient Japanese or Chinese architecture. The stairs leading up from the forest to Mystery Mountain are lit by lanterns.
<br><br>
Several booby traps are in place to protect the pagoda, including a coded lock on the door, dragon tongues and trapdoors. Next to the mountain is a usually inactive volcano.
<br><br>
The mountain contains several sources of red Sticky Splat that can sometimes shoot up from the ground like geysers.
<br><br>
The mountain is in a way sentient, and can get angry as well as be reasoned with. An Yu in particular frequently talks with the mountain. The mountain mostly communicates through a dragon statue inside the Pagoda.
<br><br>
On their first visit to Mystery Mountain, "Race Up Mystery Mountain," the PJ Masks competed with Night Ninja to get the ring first, but both failed. Despite this, the former are lucky that the latter didn't get the ring. The second time, "The Mountain Prisoner," Night Ninja forced the PJ Masks to get the ring for him by taking PJ Robot prisoner. This time they succeeded and the PJs' prize was a freed PJ Robot, but discovered the ring had no powers at all. What the ring and the traps were truly about was teaching any potential finders the value of teamwork.
<br><br>
Although he failed to obtain the ring, and since the PJ Masks failed to retrieve the Mystery Mountain Scroll from him, Night Ninja made Mystery Mountain into his new lair after these events. The mountain was next seen in "Gekko Vs. the Splatcano," in which Night Ninja transformed the mountain into a Splatcano, forcing the PJ Masks to once again travel to the mountain and stop him.
<br><br>
In "Wolfy Mountain," the Wolfies discovered Mystery Mountain and tried to take it from Night Ninja, forcing the villain to team up with the PJ Masks.
<br><br>
In "Flight of the Ninja," which was also the last appearance of Mystery Mountain in Season 2, Night Ninja planned to launch a giant Sticky Splat onto the museum.
<br><br>
In "Masters of the Mountain," Catboy and Night Ninja competed with each other in a set of races, and even worked together when they got trapped by the dragon splat tongues.
<br><br>
In "Armadylan Zen," which was also the first appearance of Mystery Mountain in Season 3, the PJ Masks took Armadylan on a zen trip to Mystery Mountain to help him to calm down, since Armadylan gets easily angry by Night Ninja and his Ninjalinos throwing sticky splats at him.
<br><br>
In "Werejalinos," the Wolfy Kids and their new allies, the Werejalinos, tried to take Mystery Mountain from Night Ninja, but the Wolfies ended up trapped by the dragon tongues, and the PJ Masks convinced the Werejalinos to give up being werewolves.
<br><br>
In "Teacher Goes Ninja," the PJ Masks went to stop Night Ninja and his Ninjalinos to rescue their Teacher.
<br><br>
In "Meet An Yu," it was revealed that An Yu is the protector of Mystery Mountain and the secrets it holds. She tried to face Night Ninja by herself, but the PJ Masks helped her out anyway.
<br><br>
In "The Secret of the Pagoda," the PJ Masks worked together with An Yu to stop Night Ninja and his Ninjalinos from stealing the Golden Wand from the pagoda. The PJs even ended up finally seeing the inside of the pagoda.
<br><br>
In "Storm of the Ninja," the PJ Masks had to help An Yu to solve an ancient riddle to stop Night Ninja from forming a storm with a staff that would help him get to the pagoda.
<br><br>
In "The PJ Rovers," the PJ Masks drove around the place using their PJ Rovers. A chase ensued with Night Ninja and his Ninjalinos as the villain wanted to have one for himself, and while he succeeded in stealing Owlette's vehicle, it stopped halfway up the mountain, and she retrieved it.
<br><br>
In the short "An Yu's Bird Rescue," An Yu invited Owlette over to relax with her. During their meditation, they assisted a baby bird in learning how to fly.
<br><br>
In the short "PJ Masks Surprise," the PJ Masks threw a surprise party for An Yu, who has not heard of the word "party." They were about to serve cake, but it gets devoured by one of the dragon statues, leaving both An Yu and the PJs stupefied for a few seconds before going straight to the dancing. This is the first time PJ Robot meets An Yu, as well as the first time since "The Mountain Prisoner" for the former to be at Mystery Mountain, although it's currently unknown when and how he properly met the latter.
<br><br>
In "The Splat Monster," the Teeny Weeny Ninjalino discovered the secret room filled with a special kind of sticky splat named Transforming Splat in the cave of Mystery Mountain.
<br><br>
In "Ninjability," Night Ninja and his Ninjalinos traveled up the mountain and into the pagoda in order to get the power of ultimate Ninjability, while Night Ninja explained what the power does.
<br><br>
In "Wheels of a Hero," Night Ninja teleported to the mountain while racing using Owlette's Owl-Glider.
<br><br>
In "Clash on Mystery Mountain," Armadylan went to take An Yu's staff from her, thinking that she was a villain at first, but realizes she wasn't actually a bad guy; he was only tricked by Night Ninja, who tried to take control of the mountain again.
<br><br>
In "A Teeny Weeny Problem," An Yu tried to train Teeny Weeny/the Splat Monster to be the Mystery Mountain's Guardian assistant.
<br><br>
In "Do The Gekko," Night Ninja stole one of the special bamboos, the same kind An Yu’s staff is made of, and filled it with Ninja Magic. An Yu wasn't able to stop the ninjas as they poof away, so she asks the PJ Masks for help, as well as discovering their daytime counterparts for the first time.
<br><br>
In "The Disappearing Ninjas," Romeo used the Sky Factory to imprison the Ninjalinos to use their power to open the sky portal to Mystery Mountain, and ordered his Fly Bots to take everything from the pagoda.
<br><br>
In "Gekko Everywhere," which was also the last appearance of An Yu in Season 3, she seemed to have changed the locks on the pagoda's gate to keep Night Ninja out, as mentioned by the latter. So in order to get in, Night Ninja had built a catapult to launch himself and his Ninjalinos into the pagoda, but had forgotten about the booby traps, which he finally realized when one of his Ninjalinos got flung out of the outside of the pagoda. Gekko got rid of the catapult later, causing Night Ninja to chase after it, and, halfway down, warned Catboy that he'll get his little green friend for that. Catboy met up with Gekko and An Yu at the top of the mountain, where she thanked Gekko for his help and warned him about the Teleporting Crystal that he has in his hand.
<br><br>
In "PJ Robot Vs Romeo," which was also the last appearance of Mystery Mountain in Season 3, the PJ Masks (though offscreen) rescued Rip and Howler from an incoming boulder.
<br><br>
In "Motsuki's Missing Sister," which was also the first appearance of Mystery Mountain in Season 4, Night Ninja and his Ninjalinos led Motsuki to the pagoda, where Luna Girl was being held prisoner.
<br><br>
In "PJ Party Mountain," Night Ninja and his Ninjalinos infiltrated the secret cave, where they find the Munki-gu statue and planned to trick the PJ Masks using An Yu's identity with the statue.
<br><br>
In "Wolfies of the Pagoda," the Wolfies infiltrated the mountain for the second time so they could play around. An Yu was soon alerted by their presence and went to stop them from causing trouble. She later hypnotized the group by playing her flute since they are in animal form.
<br><br>
In "Master Fang's Secret," Night Ninja teleported Catboy and Armadylan to the mountain's dungeon using the ninja travel spell.
<br><br>
Mystery Mountain might be a reference to Kubo and the Two Strings, a movie released in 2016. Both had Chinese and Japanese culture.
<br><br>
Unlike its book counterpart, the Bamboo Forest, Mystery Mountain isn't physically located near the city (other than being depicted as a floating island in some of its appearances), and is only located in another world or dimension. Mystery Mountain could also be a reference to Mystic Mountain in Latin America.
<br><br>
When the premiere of "Heroes of the Sky" was announced, it was revealed that the new character Munki-gu was trapped in Mystery Mountain for a thousand years for being naughty.
<br><br>
It is also the home of Birdie, as seen in some episodes. It is proven that Mystery Mountain is the source of An Yu's powers, as she loses them as soon as she leaves the mountain.</p>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">The Pagoda</button>
<div class="content1">
<p>The Pagoda is a location first seen in the episode "Race Up Mystery Mountain." It is the home of many ancient artifacts and relics and is also An Yu's home.
<br><br>
The pagoda is a temple-like building located at the top of Mystery Mountain. It is home to many ancient artifacts and relics.
<br><br>
There are stairs made of stone that lead to the magically sealed doors at the entrance of the Pagoda. There are two stone lion statues at the beginning of the stairs; one on each side. The outside of the pagoda is made out of light gray stone. Red tiles cover the roof of each of the pagoda's floors. There is also a large, mysterious triangle on the top front of the pagoda.
<br><br>
The pagoda is surrounded by several booby traps that help protect it from unwanted intruders:
<ul style="text-align:left;">
<li>The Gate to the Pagoda has a code lock on it.</li>
<li>The courtyard is filled with dragon statues that can either use their dragon tongues or a hypnotic stare to trap people.</li>
<li>There are trap doors, and large magical vines that grow onto one side of the Pagoda.</li>
<li>If required, An-Yu can even put the whole pagoda under a magic force field, as seen in "Dragon Dance".</li>
<li>The inside of the pagoda, which was first seen in "The Secret of the Pagoda," has a jade colored floor with large red pillars supporting the pagoda's structure. It has red walls with several artifacts and scrolls in them. The walls have what appear to be yellow shuriken patterns decorated all over them along with a teal lining that goes across the walls of the pagoda's first level. There are several lanterns hanging from the sealing on the inside and outside of the pagoda.</li>
</ul>
At the very back of the inside of the pagoda there is a large golden dragon statue where The Golden Wand was formerly kept. Through this statue, Mystery Mountain can communicate with the people inside the pagoda and vice-versa.
<br><br>
There are also stairs leading to the upper levels of the pagoda, but it is currently unknown what these levels look like or what relics are kept there.
<ul style="text-align:left;">
<li>Ring of Ninjability: A ring that supposedly could give the bearer three times the power, as rumored by a scroll that the PJ Masks never retrieved. But it only proves that the person have three times the power, like when the PJ Masks worked together to save PJ Robot.</li>
<li>The Red and Green Stone: Two magical stones with the powers to turn anything to stone and turn invisible respectively. Night Ninja stole them, but An Yu took them back. Judging by the dialogue between the two, there were more stones inside the pagoda, but An Yu prevented the Ninjalinos from getting them. These stones and their powers have thus yet to be revealed.</li>
<li>The Golden Wand: An ancient and mysterious relic kept inside the pagoda on Mystery Mountain. It is currently unknown what the wand's powers are.</li>
<li>The Thinking Stone: First seen in "Super Muscles Show Off," a stone as old as time. It gives the wielder the power to slow things down with their mind, but requires deep concentration to use.</li>
<li>Munki-gu Statue: First seen in "PJ Party Mountain," an ancient statue that has the power to change the appearance of others to look like someone else.</li>
<li>Wiggly Wordy Wand: First seen in "Gekko Loves Lionel," this wand has the ability to jumble up the speaker's words when they try to cast a spell, its lasting effects only temporary.</li>
<li>Ring of Invisibility: First seen in "Invisible Munki-Gu," this ring renders the wearer invisible.</li>
</ul>
The pagoda is first seen in "Race Up Mystery Mountain" when Catboy and Night Ninja competed against each other to get into the pagoda first and claim the Ring of Ninjability.</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">PJ Masks Headquarters</button>
<div class="content1">
<p>The Headquarters (mostly referred to as simply HQ) is where the PJ Masks meet up to discuss the current situation, who's involved, what to do, and which vehicle to take. The building itself is in the form of a totem pole as a disguise from the public. As of "Ninja Power Up," HQ has an upgraded appearance.
<br><br>
HQ is located inside the city's park, on a small island surrounded by a moat. The island itself can be accessed by a bridge. The Headquarters holds the following vehicles:</p>
<ul style="text-align:left;">
<li>Catboy's Cat Car, a high speed motor vehicle used to drive to the situation's location.</li>
<li>Owlette's Owl-Glider, a small red plane for flying above a situation's setting.</li>
<li>Gekko's Gekko-Mobile, a large green vehicle with underwater capabilities.</li>
<li>The PJ Rovers, three motorcycles.</li>
<li>PJ Robot's PJ Seeker, a large rescue-vehicle used to drive to the situation's location and stores the trio's PJ Rovers.</li>
<li>The PJ Sub, a submarine for underwater missions.</li>
</ul>
<p>As of the episode "Carly and Cartoka," all these vehicles are out of commission due to either being destroyed or having essential parts stolen by the Speedy Twins. They are currently kept in HQ waiting for repairs, with the exception of the Cat-Car, which is located in the Gigantogarage.
<br><br>
HQ consists of 3 sections, one for each of the PJ Masks (except for PJ Robot). Catboy's room in the center is the one most frequently visited, since it is where the PJ Masks discuss their missions. The 3 sections of HQ can rotate independently from each other. The 3 symbols on the front side of HQ can open up like doors to let the PJ Masks' vehicles out or back in. HQ can also be accessed through a door in the side, from underwater, or a hatch in the roof.
<br><br>
While it is never stated by any of the characters, HQ is notably bigger on the inside than on the outside. Outside, it seems just big enough to house the vehicles, but not much more. On the inside however, the vehicles only take up a fraction of the space in each compartment.
<br><br>
In "Gekko Vs Armavillain," it was revealed that HQ has a basement, where the PJ Seeker is kept. The basement is built into the underwater rock formation beneath HQ. HQ is equipped with the following features:
<ul style="text-align:left;">
<li>The PJ Picture Player: A holographic, spherical computer with touch screen control panel. It has many functions and abilities, including controlling everything in HQ, controlling the PJ Masks' vehicles, and acting as a surveillance-like camera to find villains easily.</li>
<li>A rocketship function: This allows HQ to take off like a rocket and fly through the air or even into space. When going into space, HQ can actually transform from a Totem Pole into a more spaceship like appearance known as the HQ Rocket (also known as the Aerototem or Spatiototem in French). The controls for this spaceship are located in Owlette's HQ room. The rocket function is for space missions, or occasionally for total disasters and emergencies only.</li>
<li>Fire Furball: A defense mechanism for firing projectile 'furballs'. It is located at Catboy's HQ room. This function can also be used in rocketship mode.</li>
<li>Mega Meow: The more powerful version of the Cat Car's Cat roar. First used in "Owlette and the Battling Headquarters."</li>
<li>Owl Beam: Another defense mechanism for temporarily blinding villains with a bright light. It is located at Owlette's HQ room. Used in "Owlette and the Battling Headquarters."</li>
<li>HQ spin: Causes HQ to spin around to deflect projectiles. Used in "Owlette and the Battling Headquarters."</li>
<li>The PJ Crystal: A crystal statue that is the source of the PJ Masks' powers. It was first discovered by PJ Robot in "PJ Power Up," and is usually stored in a hidden room of HQ. In "Take Romeo Off The Road," PJ Robot used the energy of the statue to build the PJ Seeker.</li>
<li>PJ Vault: A room where the PJ Masks store any dangerous devices and items they take from the villains, like the Moon Crystal.</li>
<li>A doorbell: A bell to ring at the ground floor entrance of HQ. Luna Girl was the first to use it, since even the PJ Masks had no idea they had a doorbell.</li>
<li>A scaring pose: It allows one of the door symbols on the HQ to emit an ominous, blinding light that can scare villains, as seen in "Halloween Tricksters."</li>
<li>A beam for each floor of HQ: Shoots a light beam so the PJ Masks can see; accidentally revealed by Armadylan in "PJ Dylan."</li>
<li>Energy Blast: While in rocket ship mode, HQ can fire a laser beam from a satellite dish on top of the ship. This was first seen in "PJ Comet."</li>
<li>The 3 symbols of the HQ: Can automatically open to launch vehicles. There are also 2 other secret entrances: an underwater entrance and a roof hatch.</li>
<li>PJ Sensors: Gadgets that enable the PJ Masks to sense things from far away. A sensor is located in each of the team member's base rooms.</li>
</ul>
<p>The PJ Masks Headquarters' physical appearance is based on its book counterpart, and takes inspiration on the Baxter Building, the headquarters of the Marvel Comics superhero team, The Fantastic Four from their titular comic book series.
<br><br>
As seen in "Owly Tricks," the PJ Masks Headquarters loses its upgraded appearance in the daytime, possibly to keep its identity secret from civilians.</p>
