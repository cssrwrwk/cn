<button type="button" class="collapsible">Camille Aigloz</button>
<div class="content1">
  <p>Camille Aigloz is a storyboard artist who worked on some storyboards for the Season 4 episodes. These were originally up at https://camilleaigloz.wixsite.com/portfolio/pj-masks during the autumn of 2019, though the website was not archived and it appears to have gone down since then as of March 12, 2020.
<br><br>
Four clips of these episodes (except "Octobella's Garden") were briefly resurfaced, but have since been removed. It was later mentioned in Tarabiscoville Messenger group that it was a big mistake and he got into trouble for publishing it online, although fortunately it is sorted out in the end. There was an October 19th thread and Wattpad article which highlighted this portfolio when it was up. There appeared to be four storyboard videos which revealed details for the following episodes:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Romeo's Space Machine," featuring Newton Star, Romeo, and Robot.<li>
<li>"Star Buddies" (this is the only one that is just a clip, which briefly resurfaced for a short time), featuring Luna Girl, Motsuki, and Newton.</li>
<li>"The Wolfy Bone," which is possibly short for "Legend of the Wolfy Bone," featuring the Wolfy Kids.</li>
<li>"Octobella's Garden," featuring Octobella and her sidekick Percival, Night Ninja (briefly), and Armadylan.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Three of them also note the replacement of Kyle Harrison Breitkopf as a voice actor for Gekko. In the "Octobella's Garden" storyboard, Armadylan also has a new actor who replaces Cristian Perri. When "Heroes of the Sky" premiered, the credits for Season 4 revealed these new actors to be Benjamin Hum and Avery Esteves, respectively. Though left unnoticed, the PJ Masks' upgraded vehicles were also leaked in said three storyboards.
<br><br>
Currently, the "Octobella's Garden" storyboard has been uploaded onto Dropbox. The full storyboards for "Romeo's Space Machine" and "Legend of the Wolfy Bone," on the other hand, have yet to resurface online in their entirety.<p>
