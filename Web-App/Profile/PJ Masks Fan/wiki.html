<div class="content">
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/VYb5hTN/character-catboy.png" alt="character-catboy" border="0">
<p>Incredibly fast! Amazingly agile! Able to hear the quietest sounds across unbelievable distances. When adventure beckons, the amazing Catboy leaps to the rescue!
<h3>Power</h3><ul><li>Super Cat Speed: His primary power, which allows him to run extremely fast. How fast exactly varies between episodes, but in the most extreme cases he is faster than the eye can see. However, he can only use this speed for short amounts of time (as seen in "Catboy and the Lunar Dome"). He can also use his speed to make things he touches go faster (as seen in "Moon Madness").</li><li>A side effect of this power is that he generates lightning while running, which he can harness for other purposes like recharging robots (as seen in "Robot Goes WrongÃ¢â‚¬Â) and the PJ Crystal (as seen in "Super Super Cat Speed").</li><li>Super Cat Ears: He has enhanced hearing, allowing him to hear sounds that would otherwise be well outside his hearing range.</li><li>Super Cat Jump: Another side effect of his super speed, he can jump much higher than a regular human.</li><li>Super Cat Leap: A combination of Super Cat Speed and Super Cat Jump that allows him to jump in a fast reaction time.</li><li>Super Cat Stripes: A power he gained in PJ Power Up; Catboy can shoot glowing blue energy stripes that can be used to tie up opponents or to grab/hold on to objects.<li>Amulet Symbol: When pressed, he can communicate with his spirit animal (represented as the Alley Cat).</li><li>Prehensile Tail: He is capable of using his cat tail to pick up objects such as a tennis racket or the remote for the Vacuum of Doom.

<p>Heâ€™s strong, sticky and a master of camouflage! Heâ€™s ready to rush into danger and save the dayâ€¦ watch out baddies, here comes the mighty Gekko!</p>
<h3>Power</h3><ul><li>Super Gekko Muscles: His primary power; he has super strength which gives him the ability to lift extremely large and heavy objects, like a Komodo dragon. The upper limits of this strength are unknown, but he has been shown to perform feats like lifting the entire museum (as shown in "Mad With Moon Power"). However, Gekko has to actively trigger this power with the phrase "Super Gekko Muscles". When this power is not in use, Gekko isn't any stronger than a regular kid his age, and can be restrained.</li><li>Super Lizard Grip: Can climb on walls and other surfaces like a gecko.</li><li>Super Gekko Camoulflage: Can turn invisible</li><li>Super Lizard Water Run: Can run on water. This power has only been used once so far like a basilisk lizard.</li><li>Color-Changing: Can change colors of his costume, like an anole lizard.</li><li>Super Gekko Shields/Super Lizard Shields: A power he gained in "PJ Power Up," he can summon two shields attached to his arms, which he can use to block incoming attacks like a turtle. The shields can also be used as projectiles when Gekko throws them.</li><li>Amulet Symbol: When pressed, he can communicate with his spirit animal (represented as Lionel).</li><li>Lizard Tail Swipe: A power gained in "Ninja Power Up," he can use his tail to create a force that can deflect incoming attacks.</li></ul>

<h3>Power</h3><ul><li>Super Owl Eyes: Can see in the dark, and see things from very far away.</li><li>Super Owl Wings: Her primary power; she can fly with her cape, like wings.</li><li>Owl Wing Wind: Can create powerful gusts of wind with her owl wings.</li><li>Super Owl Feathers: A power gained in "PJ Power Up," she can shoot energy feathers from her owl wings. These feathers come in various sizes, and can be used for multiple purposes, like projectiles, or to trap an opponent.</li><li>Super Feather Shield: An ability directly related to the above; she can use her owl feathers to create a large shield.</li><li>Super Owl Swoop: Can perform a maneuver while flying.</li><li>Amulet Symbol: When pressed, she can communicate with her spirit animal (represented as the Pigeon).</li><li>Owl Feather Nest: A power gained in "Ninja Power Up," she can create a large, cage-like nest using her owl feathers, which can be used to trap opponents.</li></ul>

<div class="content">
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/2jYRJxD/character-romeo.png" alt="character-romeo" border="0">
<p>A marvel of mechanical mischief, meet mad scientist Romeo.
With all his amazing inventions he plans to take over the world!</p>
<h3>Power</h3><ul><li>High Intelligence: Romeo doesn't possess the acrobatic and physical agility of Night Ninja and his Ninjalinos, nor the assistance of moths like Luna Girl, but he uses the power of knowledge and invention to help him take over the world.</li></ul>
</div>
 <button type="button" class="collapsible"><h2>Luna Girl</h2></button>
<div class="content">
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/KwBhN3D/character-luna-girl.png" alt="character-luna-girl" border="0">
<p>Luna Girl wants all the daytime things for herself â€“ and sheâ€™ll have a terrible tantrum if she doesnâ€™t get her way!</p>
<h3>Power</h3><ul><li>Luna Board: Luna Girl owns a hoverboard-like object called the "Luna Board" which she uses as transportation (on occasion she allows her moths to carry her places). She is able to summon the hoverboard by shouting out its name.</li><li>Luna Magnet: She owns a "Luna Magnet" which can fire a tractor beam to attract objects she wants or traps people in a moon bubble (introduced in "Way of the Woofy").</li><li>Luna Wand: Her Luna Magnet can become extra powerful when Luna Girl inserts a harvest Moon Crystal into it, and it turns into a "Luna Wand". If Luna Girl has her Luna Wand and is on the moon, she can grow large clumps of moon crystals to block or trap people and even heal the moon if it is cracked. Additionally, her Luna Wand can track Gekko when he uses his Super Gekko Camouflage, almost like a kind of heat sensor. In the episode "Owlette's Luna Trouble," Luna Girl loses her powers when an eclipse occurs. It becomes difficult for her to fly and balance on her Luna Board, and her Luna Magnet doesn't work either.</li></ul>

<div class="content">

On occasion, he will use a move called the "mega triple punch," which was demonstrated in "Gekko and the Rock of All Power."</li><li>Smoke Bombs: First introduced in "Who's Got the Owl Power?", the "Smoke Bombs" are used by Night Ninja so he can disappear and reappear wherever he wants. He runs off in the smoke and he doesn't really teleport.</li><li>Ninja Fingers: As revealed in "PJ Power Up," he and his Ninjalinos have a power called "ninja fingers," which gives them the power to telepathically levitate any object of any size with only their fingers. Their fingers glow with yellow sparkles when they use this power.</li><li>Teleportation: He is able to teleport small objects such as sticky splat and scrolls that he's stolen.</li><li>All of the PJ Masks' Powers (formerly): Night Ninja stole all of the PJ's super powers in "Ninja Power Up".

<div class="content">
<p style="text-align:center;">Season 4 is the fourth season of PJ Masks. It was announced on June 5, 2019. It was intended to be set to premiere in April 2020, but it was then moved back to May 15 2020, most likely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The fourth season majorly focuses on the upgrades of the PJ Masks' original three vehicles. One of the upgrades includes the combination of three vehicles into a new aircraft, the PJ Jet which could go to space. Another vehicle, known as the PJ Sub, is also introduced. This is the first season to have the season premiere on the Disney Junior channel. HQ introduces its basement in this season too. The PJs (with the exception of Owlette and PJ Robot) get their own PJ Wings. This is the first season to have twenty-five episodes although there still were 52 segments. This season introduces Newton Star, Munkigu, full appearance of Octobella, Percival and Pharaoh Boy.
